/// Methods for cheaply and inaccurately parsing F#.
///
/// These methods are very old and are mostly to do with extracting "long identifier islands" 
///     A.B.C
/// from F# source code, an approach taken from pre-F# VS samples for implementing intelliense.
///
/// This code should really no longer be needed since the language service has access to 
/// parsed F# source code ASTs.  However, the long identifiers are still passed back to GetDeclarations and friends in the 
/// F# Compiler Service and it's annoyingly hard to remove their use completely.
///
/// In general it is unlikely much progress will be made by fixing this code - it will be better to 
/// extract more information from the F# ASTs.
///
/// It's also surprising how hard even the job of getting long identifier islands can be. For example the code 
/// below is inaccurate for long identifier chains involving ``...`` identifiers.  And there are special cases
/// for active pattern names and so on.

    /// after the identifier.
    ///
    /// 'tolerateJustAfter' indicates that we tolerate being one character after the identifier, used
    /// for goto-definition
    ///
    /// In general, only identifiers composed from upper/lower letters and '.' are supported, but there
    /// are a couple of explicitly handled exceptions to allow some common scenarios:
    /// - When the name contains only letters and '|' symbol, it may be an active pattern, so we 
    ///   treat it as a valid identifier - e.g. let ( |Identity| ) a = a
    ///   (but other identifiers that include '|' are not allowed - e.g. '||' operator)
    /// - It searches for double tick (``) to see if the identifier could be something like ``a b``
    ///

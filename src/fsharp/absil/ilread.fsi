/// Binary reader.  Read a .NET binary and concert it to Abstract IL data
/// structures.
/// 
/// NOTE:
///   - The metadata in the loaded modules will be relative to 
///     those modules, e.g. ILScopeRef.Local will mean "local to 
///     that module".  You must use [rescopeILType] etc. if you want to include 
///     (i.e. copy) the metadata into your own module. 
///
///   - PDB (debug info) reading/folding:
///     The PDB reader is invoked if you give a PDB path 
///     This indicates if you want to search for PDB files and have the 
///     reader fold them in.  You cannot currently name the pdb file 
///     directly - you can only name the path.  Giving "None" says 
///     "do not read the PDB file even if one exists". 
/// 
///     The debug info appears primarily as I_seqpoint annotations in 
///     the instruction streams.  Unfortunately the PDB information does
///     not, for example, tell you how to map back from a class definition
///     to a source code line number - you will need to explicitly search
///     for a sequence point in the code for one of the methods of the 
///     class.  That is not particularly satisfactory, and it may be
///     a good idea to build a small library which extracts the information
///     you need.

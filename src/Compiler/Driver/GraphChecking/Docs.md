##  Parallel type-checking in Fï»¿Sharp
This document describes the idea and implementation details for parallel type-checking of independent files in the F# compiler.

Performance of F# compilation and code analysis is one of the concerns for big codebases.
One way to speed it up was originally described in https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/discussions/11634 by @kerams .
That is going to be the main topic of this page.
But before we dive into the details, let's first discuss how the things work at the moment.

## Context and the current state of the compiler

### Current state of type-checking

One of the main phases of compilation is type-checking. Depending on the project in question, it can take as much as 50% of the total compilation time.
Currently, by default all files in a project are type-checked in sequence, one-by-one, leading to increased compilation wall-clock time.

The same is true about code analysis (used by the IDEs), but to an even higher degree - since code analysis skips some of the expensive compilation phases, type-checking represents a bigger fraction of the total wall-clock time, hence any improvements in this area can lead to more drastic total time reduction.

### Maintaining type-checking state

There is a lot of information associated with type-checking individual files and groups of them.

Currently, due to the (mostly) sequential nature of the processing, it is sufficient to maintain a single instance of such information for the whole project.
This instance is incrementally built on as more and more files have been processed.

### Recent addition - "Parallel type checking for impl files with backing sig files"

A recent [change](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/13737) introduced in the compiler (not language service) added a level of parallelism in type-checking (behind an experimental feature flag).
It allows for parallel type-checking of implementation files backed by signature files.
Such files by definition cannot be depended upon by any other files w.r.t. type-checking, since all the necessary information is exposed by the corresponding `.fsi` files.

The new feature, when enabled, allows partial parallelisation of type-checking as follows:
1. All `.fsi` files and `.fs` files without backing `.fsi` files are type-checked in sequence, as before.
2. Then all `.fs` files with backing `.fsi` files are type-checked in parallel.

For a project that uses `.fsi` files throughout, such as the `FSharp.Compiler.Service` project, this presents a major speedup.

Some data points:
- [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) solution: total build time 17.49s -> 14.28s - [link](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/13737#issuecomment-1223637818)
- F# codebase build time: 112s -> 92s - [link](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/13737#issuecomment-1223386853)

#### Enabling the feature
The feature is opt-in and can be enabled in the compiler via a CLI arg & MSBuild property.

## The importance of using Server GC for parallel work

By default .NET processes use Workstation GC, which is single-threaded. What this means is it can become a bottleneck for highly-parallel operations, due to increased GC pressure and the cost of GC pauses being multiplied by the number of threads waiting. 
That is why when increasing parallelisation of the compiler and the compiler service it is important to note the GC mode being used and consider enabling Server GC.
This is no different for parallel type-checking - any performance tests of the feature should be done using Server GC. 

Below is an example showing the difference it can make for a parallel workflow.

| Workstation | Parallel        | 10849ms                                 |
| Server      | Sequential      | 14594ms (-9% vs Workstation Sequential) |
| Server      | Parallel        | 2659ms (-75% vs Workstation Parallel)   |

## Parallel type-checking of independent files

The main idea we would like to present here for speeding up type-checking is quite simple:
- process files using a dependency graph instead of doing so in a sequential order 
- based on AST information, quickly detect what files definitely do not depend on each other, trim the dependency graph and increase parallelisation possible
- implement delta-based type-checking that allows building a 'fresh' TcState copy from a list of delta-based results.

Below is some quasi-theoretical background on type-checking in general.

### Background
Files in an F# project are ordered and processed from the top (first) to the bottom (last) file.
The compiler ensures that no information, including type information, flows upwards.

Consider the following list of files in a project:
```fsharp
A.fs
B.fs
C.fs
D.fs
```
By default, during compilation they are type-checked in the order of appearance: `[A.fs, B.fs, C.fs, D.fs]`

Let's define `allowed dependency` as follows:
> If the contents of 'X.fs' _can_, based on its position in the project hierarchy, influence the type-checking process of 'Y.fs', then 'X.fs' -> 'Y.fs' is an _allowed dependency_ 

The _allowed dependencies graph_ for our sample project looks as follows:
```
A.fs -> []
B.fs -> [A.fs]
C.fs -> [B.fs; A.fs]
D.fs -> [C.fs; B.fs; A.fs]
```

Sequential type-checking of files in the appearance order guarantees that when processing a given file, all of its `allowed dependencies`  w.r.t. type-checking have already been type-checked and their type information is available.

### Necessary dependencies

Let's define a `necessary dependency` too:
> File 'X.fs' _necessarily depends_ on file `Y.fs` for type-checking purposes, if the lack of type-checking information from 'Y.fs' would influence the results of type-checking 'X.fs'

And finally a `dependency graph` as follows:
> A _dependency graph_ is any graph that is a subset of the `allowed dependencies` graph and a superset of the `necessary dependencies` graph

A few slightly imprecise/vague statements about all the graphs:
1. Any dependency graph is a directed, acycling graph (DAG).
1. The _Necessary dependencies_ graph is a subgraph of the _allowed dependencies_ graph.
2. If there is no path between 'B.fs' and 'C.fs' in the _necessary dependencies_ graph, they can in principle be type-checked in parallel (as long as there is a way to maintain more than one instance of type-checking information).
3. Type-checking _must_ process files in an order that is compatible with the topological order in the _necessary dependencies_ graph.
4. If using a dependency graph as an ordering mechanism for (parallel) type-checking, the closer it is to the _necessary dependencies_ graph, the higher parallelism is possible.
5. Type-checking files in appearance order is equivalent to using the `allowed dependencies` graph for ordering.
6. Removing an edge from the _dependency_ graph used _can_ increase (but not decrease) the level of parallelism possible and improve wall-clock time of parallel type-checking.

Let's look at point `6.` in more detail.

### The impact of reducing the dependency graph on type-checking parallelisation and wall-clock time.

Let us make a few definitions and simplifications:
1. Time it takes to type-check file f = `T(f)`
2. Time it takes to type-check files f1...fn in parallel = `T(f1+...fn)`
3. Time it takes to type-check a file f and all its dependencies = `D(f)`
4. Time it takes to type-check the graph G = `D(G)`
5. Type-checking is performed on a machine with infinite number of parallel processors.
6. There is no slowdowns due to parallel processing, ie. T(f1+...+fn) = max(T(f1),...,T(fn))

With the above it can be observed that:
```
D(G) = max(D(f)), for any file 'f'

and

D(f) = max(D(n) + T(f)) for n = any necessary dependency of 'f'
```
In other words wall-clock time for type-checking using a given dependency graph is equal to the "longest" path in the graph.

For the _allowed dependencies graph_ the following holds:
```
D(f) = T(f) + sum(T(g)), for all files 'g' above file 'f'
```
In other words, the longest path's length = the sum of times to type-check all individual files.

Therefore the change that parallel type-checking brings is the replacement of the _allowed dependencies_ graph as currently used with a reduced graph that is:
- much more similar to the _necessary dependencies_ graph,
- providing a smaller value of `D(G)`.

## A way to reduce the dependency graph used

For all practical purposes the only way to calculate the _necessary dependencies_ graph fully accurately is to perform the type-checking process, which misses the point of this exercise.

However, there exist cheaper solutions that reduce the initial graph significantly with low computational cost, providing a good trade-off.

As noted in https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/discussions/11634 , scanning the ASTs can provide a lot of information that helps narrow down the set of types, modules/namespaces and files that a given file _might_ depend on.

This is the approach used in this solution.

The dependency detection algorithm can be summarised as follows:
1. Process each file's AST in parallel and extract the following information:
    1. Top-level modules and namespaces. Consider `AutoOpens`.
    2. Opens, partial module/namespace references. Consider module abbreviations, partial opens etc.
    3. Prefixed identifiers (for example, `System.Console` in `System.Console.Write(""")`).
    4. Nested modules.
2. Build a single [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) composed of all the found namespaces and (nested) modules.
   Inside each node, we keep track of what file indices contributed to its existence.
   Note that a `Trie` has a special `Root` node. This node can be populated by top level `AutoModule` modules or `global` namespaces.
   Note that we if a file is backed by a signature, only the signature will contribute nodes to the Trie.
3. For each file, in parallel:
   1. Process all file content entries found in 2. For each file content entry, query the global Trie to see if the reference points to any file.
      Given a list of files found in the Trie nodes, add links to those of them that precede the current file.
      - Files found in the `Root` node are always considered a match, as they represent top-level, always available symbols.
      - When a file is backed by a signature, automatically add a link to its the signature file.

### Edge-case 1. - `[<AutoOpen>]`

Modules with `[<AutoOpen>]` are in a way 'transparent', meaning that all the types/nested modules inside them are surfaced as if they were on a level above.

The dependency algorithm takes this into account.
If a top level module (eg. `module Utilities`) contains an `[<AutoOpen>]` attribute, its contents is automatically available.
To take that into account, any file containing top-level AutoOpens is added to the `Root` node.

The main problem with that is that `System.AutoOpenAttribute` could be aliased and hide behind a different name.
Therefore it's not easy to see whether the attribute is being used based purely on its AST.

There are ways to evaluate this, which involve scanning all module abbreviations in the project and in any referenced dlls.
However, currently the algorithm uses a shortcut: it checks whether the attribute type name is on a hardcoded list of "suspicious" names. This is not fully reliable, as an arbitrary type alias, eg. `type X = System.AutoOpenAttribute` will not be recognised correctly.

To overcome this limitation, we decided to discourage users from creating such aliases.
We now emit a warning when an alias for `AutoOpenAttribute` is found.

Note that we do not process nested `[<AutoOpen>]` modules - this is because as soon as the top-level module is considered 'potentially used', the whole file is marked as a dependency.
An example explaining this:
```fsharp
namespace A

// If the algorithm determines module A.B is 'potentially used' in another file, there is no need to inspect its contents.
module B =

    module C =
        
        // In particular there is no need to check this AutoOpen attribute
        [<AutoOpen>]
        module D =
            ()
```

### Edge-case 2. - module abbreviations
Initially there was some concern about the impact of module abbreviations for dependency tracking algorithm.
However module abbreviations do not actually require any special handling in the current algorithm.

Consider the following example:
```
// F1.fs
module A
module B = let x = 1

// F2.fs
module C
open A
module D = B
```
Here, the line `module D = B` generates the following link: `F2.fs -> F1.fs`.
Any files that might make use of the abbreviation require a dependency onto `F2.fs`, which in turn creates an indirect dependency onto `F1.fs`.
Therefore no special handling is required for this scenario.

### Optimising the graph for files with shared namespaces
One common namespace setup in an F# project involves sharing a namespace across multiple files.
The problem this creates is that normally every `open` statement against that namespace would create a link to all the files defining it.

To help reduce the dependency graph, we detect scenarios in which the namespace itself does not contain any type definitions.
In such cases, the Trie node referring to that namespace does not link to any files directly (but its subnodes might).

Consider the following:

`A.fs`
```fsharp
module Foo.Bar.A

let a = 0
```

`B.fs`
```fsharp
module Foo.Bar.B

let b = 1
```

Such a setup creates the following Trie contents:

```mermaid
graph TB
R("Root: []")
Foo("namespace Foo: []")
Bar("namespace Bar: []")
A("module A: [ A.fs ]")
B("module B: [ B.fs ]")
R --- Foo
Foo --- Bar
Bar --- A
Bar --- B
```
Note that the `Foo` and `Bar` namespaces do not link to any files.

However, this can lead to type-checking errors.
Consider the following:

`X.fs`
```fsharp
namespace X
```

`Y.fs`
```fsharp
namespace Y

open X // This open statement is unnecessary, however it is valid F# code.
```

which leads to the following Trie:

```mermaid
graph TB
R("Root: []")
X("namespace X: []")
Y("namespace Y: []")
R --- X
R --- Y
```

To satisfy the type-checker when unused `open` statements are used, we need to make sure that at least one defining `namespace X` is a dependency of `Y.fs`. 
We call such dependencies added outside of the main dependency resolution algorithm `ghost dependencies`.

### Performance
There are two main factors w.r.t. performance of the graph-based type-checking:
1. The level of parallelisation allowed by the resolved dependency graph.
2. The overhead of creating the dependency graph and graph-based processing of the graph.
At minimum, to make this feature useful, any overhead (2.) cost should in the vast majority of use cases be significantly lower than the speedup generated by 1.

Initial timings showed that the graph-based type-checking was significantly faster than sequential type-checking and faster than the two-phase type-checking feature.
Projects that were tested included:
- `FSharp.Compiler.Service`
- `Fantomas.Core`
- `FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests`

Below are initial results for an early version of the algorithm:

```

## The problem of maintaining multiple instances of type-checking information

The parallel type-checking idea generates a problem that needs to be solved.
Instead of one instance of the type-checking information, we now have to maintain multiple instances - one for each node in the graph.
We solve it in the following way:
1. Each file's type-checking results in a 'delta' function `'State -> 'State` which adds information to the state.
2. When type-checking a new file, its input state is built from scratch by evaluating delta functions of all its dependencies.

### Ordering of diagnostics/errors

Any changes in scheduling of work that can produce diagnostics can change the order in which diagnostics appear to the end user. To retain existing ordering of diagnostics, we use a mechanism where each work item first uses a dedicated logger, and at the end individual loggers are sequentially replayed into the single logger, in the desired order. This mechanism is used in a few places in the compiler already.

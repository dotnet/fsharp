# Coding standards and idioms

The F# compiler code base is slowly being updated to better coding standards. There is a long way to go.

The future work includes

* [ ] Consistent use of fantomas formatting across as much of the codebase as feasible
* [ ] Consistent naming conventions
* [ ] Reduction in line length
* [ ] Reduction in single-character identifiers
* [ ] XML documentation for all types, members and cross-module functions

## Abbreviations

The compiler codebase uses various abbreviations. Here are some of the most common ones.

| Abbreviation        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

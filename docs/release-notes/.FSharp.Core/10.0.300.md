### Fixed

* Fix anonymous record field ordering in LINQ expression conversion to produce consistent expression trees regardless of field declaration order. ([Issue #11131](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/11131), [Issue #15648](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/15648))
* Fix array indexing in LINQ expressions to generate proper array index expressions instead of GetArray method calls, enabling LINQ providers like Azure Cosmos DB to translate array access. ([Issue #16918](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16918))
* Fix tuple join conditions and groupBy operations to properly compare tuple keys using structural equality. AnonymousObject types now implement Equals and GetHashCode, enabling inline tuple joins like `join b on ((a.Id1, a.Id2) = (b.Id1, b.Id2))` to work correctly. ([Issue #7885](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7885), [Issue #47](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/47))
* Fix tuple/multi-value projections in queries to use Queryable.Select instead of Enumerable.Select when the source is IQueryable, preserving query composition and enabling async operations like ToListAsync() in Entity Framework Core. ([Issue #3782](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/3782), [Issue #15133](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/15133))
* Fix EvaluateQuotation to handle Sequential expressions, void method calls (unit return), and other patterns that were previously throwing NotSupportedException. Also properly handles unit-returning expressions by using Action delegates instead of Func delegates. ([Issue #19099](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/19099))
* Fix query conditionals without else branch (if-then only) that were causing type mismatch errors. Now properly extracts element type from IQueryable for creating empty sequences. ([Issue #3445](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/3445))

### Fixed

* Fix anonymous record field ordering in LINQ expression conversion to produce consistent expression trees regardless of field declaration order. ([Issue #11131](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/11131), [Issue #15648](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/15648))
* Fix array indexing in LINQ expressions to generate proper array index expressions instead of GetArray method calls, enabling LINQ providers like Azure Cosmos DB to translate array access. ([Issue #16918](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16918))
* Fix tuple join conditions and groupBy operations to properly compare tuple keys using structural equality. AnonymousObject types now implement Equals and GetHashCode, enabling inline tuple joins like `join b on ((a.Id1, a.Id2) = (b.Id1, b.Id2))` to work correctly. ([Issue #7885](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7885), [Issue #47](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/47))

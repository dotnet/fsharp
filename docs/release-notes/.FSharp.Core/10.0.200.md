### Fixed

* Fix IL2091 trimming warning in `LazyExtensions.Create` by adding `DynamicallyAccessedMembers` attribute to the generic type parameter. ([Issue #17356](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17356), [PR #18302](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18302))

### Changed

* Added `not null` constraints to `IDelegateEvent<'Delegate>`, `IEvent<'Delegate,'Args>`, `DelegateEvent<'Delegate>`, and `Event<'Delegate,'Args>` types to prevent spurious nullness warnings when implementing CLIEvent properties. ([Issue #18361](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18361), [Issue #18349](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18349), [PR #19221](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19221))
* Renamed deprecated `or` and `&` operators, but keeping the original compiled names for binary compatibility. ([PR #19143](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19143))

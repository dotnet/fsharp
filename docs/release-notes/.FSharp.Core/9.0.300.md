* Struct unions with overlapping fields now generate mappings needed for reading via reflection ([Issue #18121](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17797), [PR #18274](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17877)). Previous versions of FSharp.Core returned incomplete mapping between fields and cases, these older fslib versions will now report an exception.

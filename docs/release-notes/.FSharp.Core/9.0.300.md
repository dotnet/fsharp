### Fixed

### Added
* Added nullability annotations to `.Using` builder method for `async` and `task` builders ([PR #18292](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18292))
* Add `Measure` static type and module which aids in the addition, removal, and conversion of units of measure for primitive types and common collections of primitive types. ([Language Suggestion #892](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/892)) ([RFC FS-1148 #784](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/pull/784)) ([PR #17581](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17518))

### Changed

### Breaking Changes
* Struct unions with overlapping fields now generate mappings needed for reading via reflection ([Issue #18121](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17797), [PR #18274](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18274)). Previous versions of FSharp.Core returned incomplete mapping between fields and cases, these older fslib versions will now report an exception.

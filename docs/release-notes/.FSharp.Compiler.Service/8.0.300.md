### Fixed

* Code generated files with > 64K methods and generated symbols crash when loaded. Use infered sequence points for debugging. ([Issue #16399](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16399), [#PR 16514](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16514))
* `nameof Module` expressions and patterns are processed to link files in `--test:GraphBasedChecking`. ([PR #16550](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16550))
* Graph Based Checking doesn't throw on invalid parsed input so it can be used for IDE scenarios ([PR #16575](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16575), [PR #16588](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16588), [PR #16643](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16643))
* Keep parens for problematic exprs (`if`, `match`, etc.) in `$"{(…):N0}"`, `$"{(…),-3}"`, etc. ([PR #16578](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16578))
* Fix crash in DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT mode [#PR 16471](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16471))


### Added

* The stackguard depth for ILPdbWriter.unshadowScopes can be modified via the environment variable `FSHARP_ILPdb_UnshadowScopes_StackGuardDepth`([PR #16583](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16583))
* Parser recovers on complex primary constructor patterns, better tree representation for primary constructor patterns. ([PR #16425](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16425))
* Name resolution: keep type vars in subsequent checks ([PR #16456](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16456))
* Higher-order-function-based API for working with the untyped abstract syntax tree. ([PR #16462](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16462))
* Allow returning bool instead of unit option for partial active patterns. ([Language suggestion #1041](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/1041), [PR #16473](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16473))

### Changed

* Autogenerated .Is* members for unions skipped for single-case unions. ([PR 16571](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16571))
* `implicitCtorSynPats` in `SynTypeDefnSimpleRepr.General` is now `SynPat option` instead of `SynSimplePats option`. ([PR #16425](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16425))
* `SyntaxVisitorBase<'T>.VisitSimplePats` now takes `SynPat` instead of `SynSimplePat list`. ([PR #16425](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16425))
* Reduce allocations in compiler checking via `ValueOption` usage ([PR #16323](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16323), [PR #16567](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16567))
* Reverted [#16348](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16348) `ThreadStatic` `CancellationToken` changes to improve test stability and prevent potential unwanted cancellations. ([PR #16536](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16536))
* Refactored parenthesization API. ([PR #16461])(https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16461))

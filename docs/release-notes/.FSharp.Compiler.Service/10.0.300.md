* Find All References now correctly finds active pattern cases in signature files. ([Issue #19173](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/19173), [Issue #14969](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/14969))
* Rename now correctly handles operators containing `.` (e.g., `-.-`) and allows renaming operators to other operators. ([Issue #17221](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17221), [Issue #14057](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/14057))
* Rename no longer incorrectly renames `get`/`set` keywords for properties with explicit accessors. ([Issue #18270](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18270))
* Find All References no longer crashes when an F# project contains non-F# files like `.cshtml`. ([Issue #16394](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16394))
* Find All References now correctly applies `#line` directive remapping. ([Issue #9928](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/9928))
* In `SynPat.Or` patterns, non-left-most pattern variables are now correctly classified as uses instead of bindings. ([Issue #5546](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/5546))
* Find All References now correctly finds discriminated union types defined inside modules. ([Issue #5545](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/5545))
* Synthetic event handler values are now filtered from Find All References results. ([Issue #4136](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/4136))
* Find All References now correctly finds all usages of C# extension methods. ([Issue #16993](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16993))

* Find All References on record types now includes copy-and-update expressions. ([Issue #15290](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/15290))

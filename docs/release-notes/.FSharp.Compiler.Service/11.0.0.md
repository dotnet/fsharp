* Adjust conservative method-overload duplicate detection rules for nativeptr types ([PR #18911](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18911))
* Checking: Fix checking nested fields for records and anonymous ([PR #18964](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18964))

* Syntax Tree: fix return type info for let! / and! / use! ([PR #19004](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19004))
* Fix: warn FS0049 on upper union case label. ([PR #19003](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19003))
* Type relations cache: handle potentially "infinite" types ([PR #19010](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19010))  
* Disallow recursive structs with lifted type parameters ([Issue #18993](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18993), [PR #19031](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19031))
* Fix units-of-measure changes not invalidating incremental builds. ([Issue #19049](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/19049))
* Fix race in graph checking of type extensions. ([PR #19062](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19062))
* Type relations cache: handle unsolved type variables ([Issue #19037](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/19037)) ([PR #19040](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19040))
* Fix insertion context for modules with multiline attributes. ([Issue #18671](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18671))
* Fix `--typecheck-only` for scripts stopping after processing `#load`-ed script ([PR #19048](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19048))
* Fix object expressions in struct types generating invalid IL with byref fields causing TypeLoadException at runtime. ([Issue #19068](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/19068), [PR #19070](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19070))
* Reject direct invocation of static abstract interface members on F#-defined interface types, which caused BadImageFormatException at runtime. ([Issue #19231](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/19231), [PR #19232](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19232))

### Added

* Add FSharpCodeCompletionOptions ([PR #19030](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19030))
* Type checker: recover on checking binding parameter constraints ([#19046](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19046))
* Debugger: provide breakpoint ranges for short lambdas ([#19067](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19067))
* FSharpDiagnostic: add default severity ([#19152](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19152))
* Add support for triple quoted ASCII byte string ([#19182](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19182))

### Changed

* Parallel compilation features: ref resolution, graph based checking, ILXGen and optimization enabled by default ([PR #18998](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18998))
* Make graph based type checking and parallel optimizations deterministic ([PR #19028](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19028))

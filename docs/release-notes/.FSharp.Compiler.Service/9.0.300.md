### Fixed
* Fix Realsig+ generates nested closures with incorrect Generic  ([Issue #17797](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17797), [PR #17877](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17877))
* Fix optimizer internal error for records with static fields  ([Issue #18165](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18165), [PR #18280](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18280))
* Fix nullness warning with flexible types  ([Issue #18056](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18056), [PR #18266](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18266))
* Fix internal error when missing measure attribute in an unsolved measure typar. ([Issue #7491](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7491), [PR #18234](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18234)==
* Set `Cancellable.token` from async computation ([Issue #18235](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18235), [PR #18238](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18238))
* Fix missing nullness warning when static upcast dropped nullness ([Issue #18232](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18232), [PR #18261](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18261))
* Cancellable: only cancel on OCE with own token ([PR #18277](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18277))
* Cancellable: set token in more places ([PR #18283](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18283))

### Added
* Added missing type constraints in FCS. ([PR #18241](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18241))
* The 'use' keyword can be used on IDisposable|null without nullness warnings ([PR #18262](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18262))
* Symbols: Add FSharpAssembly.IsFSharp ([PR #18290](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18290))

### Changed

* FSharpCheckFileResults.ProjectContext.ProjectOptions will not be available when using the experimental Transparent Compiler feature. ([PR #18205](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18205))
* Update `Obsolete` attribute checking to account for `DiagnosticId` and `UrlFormat` properties. ([PR #18224](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18224))
* Remove `Cancellable.UsingToken` from tests ([PR #18276](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18276))

### Breaking Changes
* Struct unions with overlapping fields now generate mappings needed for reading via reflection ([Issue #18121](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17797), [PR #18274](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17877))

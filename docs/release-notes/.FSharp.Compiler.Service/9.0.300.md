* Fix missing nullness warning when static upcast dropped nullness ([Issue #18232](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18232), [PR #18261](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18261))
* Cancellable: only cancel on OCE with own token ([PR #18277](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18277))
* Cancellable: set token in more places ([PR #18283](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18283))
* Cancellable: fix leaking cancellation token ([PR #18295](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18295))
* Fix NRE when accessing nullable fields of types within their equals/hash/compare methods ([PR #18296](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18296))

### Added
* Added missing type constraints in FCS. ([PR #18241](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18241))

* Symbols: Add FSharpAssembly.IsFSharp ([PR #18290](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18290))
* Type checker: don't suppress errors while checking expressions ([PR #18311](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18311))

### Changed

* FSharpCheckFileResults.ProjectContext.ProjectOptions will not be available when using the experimental Transparent Compiler feature. ([PR #18205](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18205))

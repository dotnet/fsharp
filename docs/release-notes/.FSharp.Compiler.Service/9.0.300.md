* Cancellable: only cancel on OCE with own token ([PR #18277](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18277))

* Cancellable: fix leaking cancellation token ([PR #18295](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18295))
* Fix NRE when accessing nullable fields of types within their equals/hash/compare methods ([PR #18296](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18296))
* Fix nullness warning for overrides of generic code with nullable type instance ([Issue #17988](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17988), [PR #18337](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18337))
* Unsafe downcast from `obj` to generic `T` no longer requires `not null` constraint on `T`([Issue #18275](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18275), [PR #18343](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18343))

### Added
* Added missing type constraints in FCS. ([PR #18241](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18241))
* The 'use' keyword can be used on IDisposable|null without nullness warnings ([PR #18262](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18262))
* Add support for C# `Experimental` attribute. ([PR #18253](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18253))
* Nullness warnings are issued for signature<>implementation conformance ([PR #18186](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18186))
* Symbols: Add FSharpAssembly.IsFSharp ([PR #18290](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18290))
* Type parameter constraint `null` in generic code will now automatically imply `not struct` ([Issue #18320](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18320), [PR #18323](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18323))

### Changed

* FSharpCheckFileResults.ProjectContext.ProjectOptions will not be available when using the experimental Transparent Compiler feature. ([PR #18205](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18205))
* Update `Obsolete` attribute checking to account for `DiagnosticId` and `UrlFormat` properties. ([PR #18224](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18224))
* Remove `Cancellable.UsingToken` from tests ([PR #18276](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18276))
* Added nullability annotations to `.Using` builder method for `async`, `task` and compiler-internal builders ([PR #18292](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18292))
* Warn when `unit` is passed to an `obj`-typed argument  ([PR #18330](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18330))
* Warning for "useless null handling" works with piped syntax constructs now ([PR #18331](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18331))

### Breaking Changes
* Struct unions with overlapping fields now generate mappings needed for reading via reflection ([Issue #18121](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17797), [PR #18274](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17877))

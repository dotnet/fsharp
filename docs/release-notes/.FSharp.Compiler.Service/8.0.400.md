* Fix for exponential runtime in CE builders when using nested implicit yields [PR #17096](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17096)
* Fix several AND operator parser bugs and regressions ([Issue #16447](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16447), [Issue #17134](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17134), [Issue #16309](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16309), [PR #17113](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17113))
* Treat exceptions as types in a namespace for graph based type checking ([Issue #17262](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17262), [PR #17268](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17268))

### Added

* Generate new `Equals` overload to avoid boxing for structural comparison ([PR #16857](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16857))

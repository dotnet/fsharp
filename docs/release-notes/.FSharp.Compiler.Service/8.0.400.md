* Static abstract method on classes no longer yields internal error. ([Issue #17044](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17044), [PR #17055](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17055))
* Disallow calling abstract methods directly on interfaces. ([Issue #14012](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/14012), [Issue #16299](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16299), [PR #17021](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17021))
* Various parenthesization API fixes. ([PR #16977](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16977)) 
* Files passed with -embed:relative/path/to/file are not embedded. ([Issue #16768](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17068))
* Fix bug in optimization of for-loops over integral ranges with steps and units of measure. ([Issue #17025](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17025), [PR #17040](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17040), [PR #17048](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17048))
* Fix calling an overridden virtual static method via the interface ([PR #17013](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17013))
* Fix state machines compilation, when big decision trees are involved, by removing code split when resumable code is detected ([PR #17076](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17076))
* Fix for exponential runtime in CE builders when using nested implicit yields [PR #17096](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17096)
* Fix several AND operator parser bugs and regressions ([Issue #16447](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16447), [Issue #17134](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17134), [Issue #16309](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/16309), [PR #17113](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17113))

### Added

* Generate new `Equals` overload to avoid boxing for structural comparison ([PR #16857](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16857))

### Changed

* Minor compiler perf improvements. ([PR #17130](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17130))
* Improve error of Active Pattern case Argument Count Not Match ([PR #16846](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/16846))

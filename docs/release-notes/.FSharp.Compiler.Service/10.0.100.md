* Import `IEnumerable` as `seq`. ([PR #18865](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18865))

### Breaking Changes

* Scoped Nowarn: Add the #warnon compiler directive ([Language suggestion #278](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/278), [RFC FS-1146 PR](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/pull/782), [PR #18049](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18049) and [PR #18637](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18637))
* Simplify creation of `FSharpDiagnostics`. In a few cases, errors without ranges were assigned to the currently checked file, while in other cases they carried an empty range. The latter is now true in all cases. In a few cases, ranges at eof were corrected, while in others they were not. They are now always left uncorrected. This is a prerequisit for [#18553](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18553). ([PR #18610](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18610)).
* `SynExprRecordField` now includes a `range` field ([PR #18617](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18617))
* Mark `Range.Zero` as obsolete in favor of `Range.range0` ([PR #18664](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18664))
* Use `Synbinding` to model `and!` ([PR #18805](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18805))
* Redesign #line processing. The original positions (unaffected by #line directives) are now kept in the AST, and `__LINE__` and `__SOURCE_LINE__` show the original line numbers / file names. However, all diagnostics and debug information stays the same (shows the position transformed by the #line directives). ([Issue #18553](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18553), [PR #18699](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18699), [PR 18828](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18828), [PR 18829](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18829))
* Unify `let`, `let!`, `use` and `use!` AST representation. ([PR #18825](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18825))[^1]

### Migration Guidance for AST Users

**Note:** The unified AST introduces two new boolean fields:
- `isFromSource`: Indicates if the binding comes from user-written code (`true`) or is compiler-generated (`false`)
- `isBang`: Distinguishes computation expression bindings (`let!`/`use!` = `true`) from regular bindings (`let`/`use` = `false`)

### 1. Pattern Matching Updates

**Before:**
```fsharp
match expr with
| SynExpr.LetOrUse(isRec, isUse, bindings, body, range, trivia) ->
    // Handle regular let/use
| SynExpr.LetOrUseBang(spBind, isUse, isFromSource, pat, rhs, andBangs, body, range, trivia) ->
    // Handle let!/use!
```

**After:**
```fsharp
match expr with
| SynExpr.LetOrUse(isRec, isUse, isFromSource, isBang, bindings, body, range, trivia) ->
    if isBang then
        // This is a let!/use! expression
        match bindings with
        | firstBinding :: andBangs ->
            match firstBinding with
            | SynBinding(headPat = pat; expr = rhs) ->
                // pat and rhs extracted from first binding
                // andBangs contains the and! bindings
        | [] -> // error case
    else
        // This is a regular let/use expression
```

### 2. Construction Updates

**Before:**
```fsharp
// Creating a let! expression
SynExpr.LetOrUseBang(
    bindDebugPoint,
    false,  // isUse
    true,   // isFromSource
    pat,
    rhsExpr,
    andBangs,
    bodyExpr,
    range,
    trivia
)
```

**After:**
```fsharp
// Creating a let! expression
let firstBinding = SynBinding(
    accessibility = None,
    kind = SynBindingKind.Normal,
    isInline = false,
    isMutable = false,
    attributes = [],
    xmlDoc = PreXmlDoc.Empty,
    valData = SynInfo.emptySynValData,
    headPat = pat,           // Pattern moved here
    returnInfo = None,
    expr = rhsExpr,          // RHS moved here
    range = range,
    debugPoint = bindDebugPoint,  // Debug point moved here
    trivia = bindingTrivia
)
SynExpr.LetOrUse(
    false,  // isRecursive
    false,  // isUse
    true,   // isFromSource
    true,   // isBang (indicates let!)
    firstBinding :: andBangs,  // All bindings in single list
    bodyExpr,
    range,
    trivia
)
```

### 3. Common Migration Patterns

**Checking for computation expressions:**
```fsharp
// Before
match expr with
| SynExpr.LetOrUseBang _ -> true
| _ -> false

// After
match expr with
| SynExpr.LetOrUse(isBang = true) -> true
| _ -> false
```

**Extracting pattern and expression from let!:**
```fsharp
// Before
| SynExpr.LetOrUseBang(_, _, _, pat, rhs, _, _, _, _) ->
    processBinding pat rhs

// After
| SynExpr.LetOrUse(isBang = true; bindings = binding :: _) ->
    match binding with
    | SynBinding(headPat = pat; expr = rhs) ->
        processBinding pat rhs
    | _ -> // error
```

**Processing and! bindings:**
```fsharp
// Before
| SynExpr.LetOrUseBang(_, _, _, firstPat, firstRhs, andBangs, _, _, _) ->
    processFirst firstPat firstRhs
    for andBang in andBangs do
        processAndBang andBang

// After
| SynExpr.LetOrUse(isBang = true; bindings = bindings) ->
    match bindings with
    | first :: rest ->
        processBinding first
        for andBang in rest do
            processAndBang andBang
    | [] -> // error
```

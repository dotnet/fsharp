### Added
* Add opt-in warning attribute not valid for union case with fields [PR #18532](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18532))
* Add support for `when 'T : Enum` library-only static optimization constraint. ([PR #18546](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18546))

### Fixed

* Fix parsing errors using anonymous records and units of measures ([PR #18543](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18543))
* Fix parsing errors using anonymous records and code quotations ([PR #18603](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18603))
* Fixed: Allow `return`, `return!`, `yield`, `yield!` type annotations without parentheses ([PR #18533](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18533))
* Allow `let!` and `use!` type annotations without requiring parentheses ([PR #18508](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18508))
* Fix find all references for F# exceptions ([PR #18565](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18565))
* Shorthand lambda: fix completion for chained calls and analysis for unfinished expression ([PR #18560](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18560))
* Completion: fix previous namespace considered opened [PR #18609](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18609)
* Fix active pattern typechecking regression. ([Issue #18638](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18638), [PR #18642](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18642))

### Changed
* Use `errorR` instead of `error` in `CheckDeclarations.fs` when possible. ([PR #18645](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18645))

### Breaking Changes

* Scoped Nowarn: Add the #warnon compiler directive ([Language suggestion #278](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/278), [RFC FS-1146 PR](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/pull/782), [PR #18049](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18049) and [PR #18637](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18637))
* Simplify creation of `FSharpDiagnostics`. In a few cases, errors without ranges were assigned to the currently checked file, while in other cases they carried an empty range. The latter is now true in all cases. In a few cases, ranges at eof were corrected, while in others they were not. They are now always left uncorrected. This is a prerequisit for [#18553](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18553). ([PR #18610](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18610)).
* `SynExprRecordField` now includes a `range` field ([PR #18617](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18617))
* Mark `Range.Zero` as obsolete in favor of `Range.range0` ([PR #18664](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18664))

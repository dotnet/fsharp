* Change compiler default setting for compressedMetadata ([Issue #17379](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17379), [PR #17383](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17383))
* Treat `{ new Foo() }` as `SynExpr.ObjExpr` ([PR #17388](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17388))
* Optimize metadata reading for type members and custom attributes. ([PR #17364](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17364))

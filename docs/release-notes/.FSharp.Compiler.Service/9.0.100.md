* Fix reporting IsFromComputationExpression only for CE builder type constructors and let bindings. ([PR #17375](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17375))
* Optimize simple mappings in comprehensions when the body of the mapping has `let`-bindings and/or sequential expressions before a single yield. ([PR #17419](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17419))

### Added

* Support for nullable reference types ([PR #15181](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/15181))

* Change compiler default setting for compressedMetadata ([Issue #17379](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17379), [PR #17383](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17383))
* Treat `{ new Foo() }` as `SynExpr.ObjExpr` ([PR #17388](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17388))
* Optimize metadata reading for type members and custom attributes. ([PR #17364](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17364))
* Enforce `AttributeTargets` on unions. ([PR #17389](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17389))

* Treat `{ new Foo() }` as `SynExpr.ObjExpr` ([PR #17388](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17388))
* Optimize metadata reading for type members and custom attributes. ([PR #17364](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17364))
* Enforce `AttributeTargets` on unions. ([PR #17389](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/17389))

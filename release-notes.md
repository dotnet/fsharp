### Visual Studio 16.5

The primary focus of this release has been improving the [performance and scalability of large F# codebases in Visual Studio](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/8255). This work was influenced by working directly with customers who have very large codebases. The performance work is [still ongoing](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6866), but if you have a medium-to-large sized codebase, you should see reduced memory usage.

Beyond performance enhancements, this release includes a variety of other fixes, many of which were contributed by our wonderful F# OSS community.

#### F# language

Several F# preview language features have been merged. You can try them out by setting your `LangVersion` to `preview` in your project file.

### Visual Studio 16.3

This release includes support for F# 4.7, the newest version of the F# language!

Much of F# 4.7 was dedicated to underlying infrastructural changes that allow us to deliver preview of F# language functionality more effectively. That said, there are still some nice new features delivered as well.

#### F# language and core library

We added support for F# 4.7, a minor language release that comes with compiler infrastructure to enable preview features so that we can get feedback on feature designs earlier in the development process.

The full F# 4.7 feature set is:

* Support for the `LangVersion` flag, which allows for configuring the F# language version used by the compiler to be F# 4.6 or higher
* Support for [implicit yields](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp-4.7/FS-1069-implicit-yields.md) in array, list, and sequence expressions
* [Indentation requirement relaxations](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp-4.7/FS-1070-offside-relaxations.md) for static members and constructors
* [Relaxing the need for a double-underscore (`__`)](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp-4.7/FS-1046-wildcard-self-identifiers.md) in [member declarations](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/6829) and [`for` loops](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/6867), contributed by [Gustavo Leon](https://github.com/gusty)
* FSharp.Core now targets `netstandard2.0` instead of `netstandard1.6`, following the deprecation of support for .NET Core 1.x
* FSharp.Core on .NET Core now supports `FSharpFunc.FromConverter`, `FSharpFunc.ToConverter`, and `FuncConvert.ToFSharpFunc`
* FSharp.Core now supports [`Async.Sequential` and an optional `maxDegreeOfParallelism` parameter for `Async.Parallel`](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp.Core-4.7.0/FS-1067-Async-Sequential.md), contributed by [Fraser Waters](https://github.com/Frassle)

In addition to the F# 4.7 feature set, this release includes support for the following preview F# language features:

* Support for [`nameof` expressions](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/preview/FS-1003-nameof-operator.md)
* Support for opening of static classes

You can enable this by seeting `<LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>` in your project file.

This release also contains the following bug fixes and improvements to the F# compiler:

* A longstanding issue where the F# compiler could stack overflow with massive records, structs, or other types has been resolved ([#7070](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7070))
* An issue where specifying invalid inline IL could crash Visual Studio has been resolved ([#7164](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7164)
* Resolution of an issue where copying of a struct would not occur if it was defined in C# and mutated in a member call ([#7406](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7406))
* A crypto hash of the portable PDB content created by the compiler is not included in the PE debug directory, with a configurable hash set to SHA-256 by default ([#4259](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/4259), [#1223](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/1223))
* A bug where `LeafExpressionConverter` ignored `ValueType` and assumed `System.Tuple` has been fixed ([#6515](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6515)) by [Kevin Malenfant](https://github.com/kevmal)
* A bug where `List.transpose` discaded data instead of throwing an exception has been resolved ([#6908](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6908)) by [Patrick McDonald](https://github.com/PatrickMcDonald)
* A bug where `List.map3` gave a misleading error when used on lists of different lengths has been resolved ([#6897](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6897)) by [reacheight](https://github.com/reacheight)

#### F# tools

This release also includes a few improvements to the F# tools for Visual Studio:

* Records are formatted more to look more like canonical declarations and values in tooltips and F# interactive ([#7163](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7163))
* Properties in tooltips now specify whether or not that are `get`-only, `set`-only, or `get` and `set` ([#7007](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7007))
* An issue where Go to Definition and other features could not always work across projects when files use forward slashes ([#4446](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/4446), [#5521](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/5521), [#4016](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/4016)) has been fixed, with help from [chadunit](https://github.com/chadunit)
* Issues with anonymous records and debugging have been resolved ([#6728](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6728), [#6512](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6512))
* A bug where empty hash directives in source could make source text coloring seem random has been resolved ([#6400](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/6400), [#7000](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/7000))

### Visual Studio 16.1

This is a relatively minor release for the F# language and tools, but it's not without some goodies! As with the VS 16.0 update, this release also focused on performance of editor tooling.

#### F# compiler and F# interactive

* Added `P/Invoke` support to F# interactive on .NET Core ([#6544](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6544))
* Added a compiler optimization for `Span<'T>` when used in a `for` loop ([#6195](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6195))
* Added an optimization to avoid an extraneous `Some` allocations for F# options in various scenarios ([#6532](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6532))
* Changed the execution order of expressions used in the instantiation of Anonymous Records to be top-to-bottom, rather than alphabetical, to match the current experience with normal Records ([#6487](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6487))
* A bug where very large literal expressions or very large struct declarations could cause the compiler to stack overflow on build has been resolved ([#6258](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6258))
* A bug where breakpoints would no longer trigger when debugging a function with an Anonymous Records has been fixed ([#6512](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6512))
* A bug where Anonymous Records passed to constructs expecting an `obj` parameter caused a compiler crash has been fixed ([#6434](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6434))
* A bug where `for var expr1 to expr2 do ...` loops could result in bizarrely valid (and discarded) syntax has been fixed ([#6586](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6586))
* A bug where Anonymous Records could not be used properly with events has been fixed ([#6572](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6572))
* A longstanding bug where extremely large generated parsers in FsLexYacc (over 100 million lines) has been resolved ([#5967](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5976])
* A longstanding issue in the Type Provider plugin component of the compiler that could leave the door open for a memory leak caused by a type provider has been resolved ([#6409](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6409))
* Support for `--pathmap` was added to the F# compiler by [Saul Rennison](https://github.com/saul), which resolves an issue where the resulting executable from a compilation would include absolute paths to source files in the embedded F# signature file resource ([#5213](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5213))
* An optimization to the F# AST that improves its consumption via other tools and enviroments (e.g., [Fable](https://fable.io/)) has been added by [ncave](https://github.com/ncave) ([#6333](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/6333))
* An optimization around traversing information when resolving members has been added by [Steffen Forkmann](https://github.com/forki) ([#4457](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/4457))
* An improvement to error messages such that when a type implementation is missing necessary overrides a list of those missing overrides is reported has been added by [Gauthier Segay](https://github.com/smoothdeveloper) ([#4982](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/4982))

#### F# tools

* The Target Framework dropdown for F# projects in the .NET SDK will now include values for all available .NET Core, .NET Standard, and .NET Framework values to ease migrating to .NET Core from .NET Framework on the .NET SDK
* A bug where renaming generic type parameters produces double backtick-escaped names has been fixed ([#5389](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5389))
* A longstanding problem where Type Providers were redundantly reinstantiated, causing massive allocations over time, has been resolved ([#5929](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5929))
* A longstanding issue where reading IL needlessly allocated 20MB over a short period of time was been resolved ([#6403](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6403))
* A bug where the method `GetToolTipText` in the F# compiler service could show the same XML signature for several member overloads has been resolved by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko) ([#6244](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6244))

#### F# open source infrastructure

Finally, we improved the contribution experience by doing the following:

* Completed our build from source process so that the F# compiler and core library can be built with the .NET Core source build repository
* Removed our dependency on `netstandard1.6` so that the entire codebase uniformly targets `netstandard2.0` and `net472`
* Added a `.vsconfig` file to the root of the repository so that contributors using Visual Studio don't have to know everything that needs installing up front
* Rewrote our project's [README](https://github.com/microsoft/visualfsharp) to remove potentially confusing information, include a quickstart for getting started with contributing, and attempting to be more inclusive in our messaging about the kinds of changes we'd love to take

### Visual Studio 16.0

F# improvements in Visual Studio 2019 are in three major areas:

* F# 4.6
* Major performance improvements for medium and larger solutions
* Lots of open source work by our excellent open source community

#### F# 4.6

This release contains the F# 4.6 language:

* [Anonymous Record types](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp-4.6/FS-1030-anonymous-records.md) have been added to the language, including full tooling support and the ability to emit them types into JavaScript objects via the [Fable](https://fable.io/) compiler.
* [ValueOption type and ValueOption module function parity with Option type](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp.Core-4.6.0/FS-1065-valueoption-parity.md).
* [tryExactlyOne function for arrays, lists, and sequences](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/FSharp.Core-4.6.0/FS-1065-valueoption-parity.md), contributed by [Grzegorz Dziadkiewicz](https://github.com/gdziadkiewicz).

#### F# compiler and FSharp.Core improvements

The F# and compiler and FSharp.Core have seen numerous improvements, especially from open source contributors:

* **fsi.exe** and **fsc.exe** now defaults to .NET Framework 4.7.2, allowing the loading of components targeting this framework or lower ([#4946](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/4946)).
* We optimized methods on structs and struct records to perform as well as methods on classes and class-based records (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/3057">#3057</a>).
* We optimized the emitted IL for combined Boolean logic in F# code (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/635">#635</a>).
* We've optimized the use of `+` with strings in F# to call the minimal amount of `String.Concat` calls as possible ([#5560](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5560)).
* We fixed an issue in the FSharp.Core package where some extra directories with test assets were included. FSharp.Core 4.5.5 and 4.6.1 should have the fix ([#5814](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5814)).
* When a user-defined attribute does not inherit from the `Attribute` class, you will now receive a warning, by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* The `AssemblyInformationVersionAttribute` value in a project file now supports arbitrary values to support scenarios such as SourceLink (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/4822">#4822</a>).
* A bug where illegal syntax with Active Patterns would cause an internal compiler error has been fixed by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/forki">Steffen Forkmann</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5745">#5745</a>).
* A bug where the `Module` suffix was erroneously added to a module in a recursive module to match a type where the only difference is a generic parameter was fixed by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Booksbaum">BooksBaum</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5794">#5794</a>).
* An improvement to the error message when type parameters are not adjacent to a type name has been improved by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/voronoipotato">Alan Ball</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/4183">#4183</a>).
* The `uint16` literal suffix is listed correctly in the error messages for invalid numeric literals, by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis">Teo Tsirpanis</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/5712">#5712</a>).
* Error messages for computation expressions no longer state `async` in the message and instead refer to "computation expression(s)", by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/jwosty">John Wostenberg</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5343">#5343</a>).
* An error message when incorrectly referencing `.dll`s in F# interactive was fixed by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Horusiath">Bartoz Sypytkowski</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/5416">#5416</a>).
* A bug where Statically Resolved Type Parameters couldn't handle calling a member that hides an inherited member was fixed by [Victor Peter Rouven Müller](https://github.com/realvictorprm) ([#5531](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5531)).
* Various smaller performance improvements to the compiler have been added by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/forki">Steffen Forkmann</a> and <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/rojepp">Robert Jeppesen</a>.

#### F# performance improvements

Another big focus area for F# in Visual Studio 2019 has been performance for medium and large solutions. We addressed some very long-standing issues, some of which dating back to the very first edition of F# tools for Visual Studio. We also got some help from the excellent F# open source community.

* We've revamped how the F# language service is initialized by Roslyn. Type colorization for larger solutions should generally appear sooner.
* We changed our representation of source text to avoid large allocations over time, especially with bigger files ([#5935](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5935), [#5936](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5936), [#5937](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5937), [#4881](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/4881)).
* We changed our build caches for small edits to files to use significantly less memory ([#6028](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6028)).
* We modified a compiler feature that suggests names when unrecognized tokens are typed to only compute these suggestions on-demand, resulting in significant CPU and memory reductions when typing slowly in larger solutions ([#6044](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6044)).
* We changed IntelliSense so that it will no longer show symbols from unopened namespaces by default. This notably improves performance for IntelliSense in projects with many references. This feature can be turned back on in the settings via **Tools > Options > Text Editor > F# > IntelliSense**.
* We improved memory usage when using Type Providers to generate very large amounts of provided types in a completion list (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/5599">#5599</a>).
* A reduction to CPU and memory usage to an internal string comparison algorithm for suggesting unrecognized names has been fixed by [Avi Avni](https://github.com/aviavni) ([#6050](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/6050)).
* A notable source of large string allocations, particularly for IDE tooling, was fixed by [Avi Avni](https://github.com/aviavni) ([#5922](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5922)).
* A notable source of Large Object Heap allocations coming from computing IntelliSense has been fixed by [Chet Husk](https://github.com/baronfel) ([#6084](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/6084))

#### F# tooling improvements

In addition to performance improvements, various other improvements to F# tooling for Visual Studio 2019 have been made:

* The Add `open` statement code fix will now default to adding the `open` statement at the top of the file.
* We fixed a bug where `match!` in user code invalidated structure guidelines and code outlining nodes for subsequent scopes (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5456">#5456</a>).
* The editor will now correctly color `byref`, `outref`, and `ref` values as record fields with the mutable value colorization (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5579">#5579</a>).
* We fixed a bug where the rename refactoring did not recognize the `'` character in symbol names (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5604">#5604</a>).
* We've fixed a longstanding bug where renaming F# script files resulted in a loss of colorization data ([#1944](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/1944)).
* We cleaned up IntelliSense so that it doesn't show unrelated items in the list when pressing backspace.
* With "Smart" indentation on, pasting F# code into the editor will now format it to match an appropriate scope based on the current cursor position, implemented by <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/saul">Saul Rennison</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/4702">#4702</a>).
* An issue where F# editor options weren't syncing has been fixed by [Jakob Majocha](https://github.com/majocha) ([#5997](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5997), [#5998](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/5998)).
* A bug where IntelliSense in a constructor within an `inherit` clause wouldn't show the primary constructor has been fixed by [Eugene Auduchinok](https://github.com/auduchinok) ([#3699](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/3699))
* Various smaller improvements to the F# language service have been made by [Eugene Auduchinok](https://github.com/auduchinok)

##### F# open source infrastructure

We've fully migrated the F# and F# tools codebase to use the .NET SDK. This dramatically simplifies the contribution process for developers, especially if they are not using Windows. Additionally, [Jakob Majocha](https://github.com/majocha) has helped in cleaning up documents for new contributors in light of the changes to the codebase.

### Visual Studio 15.9

You can find all tracked VS 15.9 items in the [15.9 milestone](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/milestone/24).

#### F# Compiler

* Fix (#4637) - Can't debug FCS when compiled with portable pdb debug symbols, by [Jason Imison](https://github.com/nosami).
* Fix (#5355) - We fixed a bug where extension methods that take `byref` values could mutate an immutable value.
* Fix (#5446) - We improved the compile error information for overloads on `byref`/`inref`/`outref`, rather than displaying the previously obscure error.
* Fix (#5354) - Optional Type Extensions on `byref`s are now disallowed entirely. They could be declared previously, but were unusable, resulting in a confusing user experience.
* Fix (#5294) - We fixed a bug where `CompareTo` on a struct tuple and causing a type equivalence with an aliased struct tuple would result in a runtime exception.
* Fix (#5621) - We fixed a bug where use of `System.Void` in the context of authoring a Type Provider for .NET Standard could fail to find the `System.Void` type at design-time.
* Fix (#5468) - We fixed a bug where an internal error could occur when a partially applied Discriminated Union constructor is mismatched with an annotated or inferred type for the Discriminated Union.
* Fix (#5540) - We modified the compiler error message when attempting to take an address of an expression (such as accessing a property) to make it more clear that it violates scoping rules for `byref` types.
* Fix (#5536) - We fixed a bug where your program could crash at runtime when partially applying a `byref` type to a method or function. An error message will now display.
* Fix (#5459) - We fixed an issue where an invalid combination of a `byref` and a reference type (such as `byref<int> option`) would fail at runtime and not emit an error message. We now emit an error message.

#### F# Tools for Visual Studio

* Fix (#5657) - We resolved an issue where metadata for F# assemblies built with the .NET Core SDK was not shown in file properties on Windows. You can now see this metadata by right-clicking an assembly on Windows and selecting **Properties**.
* Fix (#5615) - We fixed a bug where use of `module global` in F# source could cause Visual Studio to become unresponsive.
* Fix (#5515) - We fixed a bug where extension methods using `inref<'T>` would not show in completion lists.
* Fix (#5514) - We fixed a bug where the TargetFramework dropdown in Project Properties for .NET Framework F# projects was empty.
* Fix (#5507) - We fixed a bug where File | New Project on a .NET Framework 4.0 project would fail.

#### F# OSS Build

* Feature (#5027) - Set VisualFSharpFull as the default startup project, by [Robert Jeppesen](https://github.com/rojepp).

### Visual Studio 15.8.5

* Fix (#5504) - Internal MSBuild Error when building non-.NET SDK projects with MSBuild parallelism
* Fix (#5518) - Visual Studio-deployed components are not NGEN'd
* Fix ([Devcom 322883](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/322883/all-net-framework-f-projects-build-to-4500-regardl.html)) - FSharp.Core 4.5.0.0 binary is deployed to FSharp.Core 4.4.3.0 location

All other closed issues for the VS 15.8 release can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/milestone/14).

### F# 4.5

We introduced the F# language version 4.5 with this release. This also corresponds with the new 4.5.x family of FSharp.Core (the F# core library). You can read the specs for each of these changes in the [F# RFC repository](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design). There are also many improvements to F# tools for Visual Studio with this release.

* Respecting `#nowarn "2003"`
* Other smaller performance improvements and many bug fixes

#### Tooling improvements

Significant improvements in the F# tools, such as performance enhancements and some new editor features are included this release. As always, with a large number of contributions from the F# open source community. Here are the highlights:

* We improved IntelliSense performance for .NET SDK-style projects of all forms, including those that use multi-targeting.
* A community-driven effort to analyze and improve IntelliSense performance for very large files was contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko),[ Steffen Forkmann](https://github.com/forki), and [Gauthier Segay](https://github.com/smoothdeveloper). IntelliSense in very large files (10k+ lines of code) is roughly twice as fast now.
* The warning for an outdated FSharp.Core (despite the package being installed) is no longer present in .NET SDK-style projects.
* The description tooltip that displays XML documentation for a member after . in IntelliSense no longer times out after 10 seconds.
* A bug where you could not set breakpoints in object constructor arguments has been fixed.
* A bug where a renamed symbol would be duplicated when it is a generic parameter has been fixed.
* Templates for .NET Framework (classic F# templates) now consume FSharp.Core from a NuGet package, to align with .NET SDK F# templates.
* Automatic, transactional brace completion is now available for `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `[||]`, and `[<>]` brace pairs. We did this work in collaboration with [Gibran Rosa](https://github.com/gibranrosa).
* You can now go to definition with **Ctrl + Click** on an F# symbol. The settings for this gesture are also respected in the **Tools > Options** window.
* The IntelliSense performance UI has been modified to allow configuration of stale typecheck information for various IDE features. Explanations for each option are now present in tooltips for the settings.
* Brace match highlighting now correctly highlights braces, completed in collaboration with [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Go to definition now navigates correctly when a type is defined recursively, contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where an auto-imported namespace wasn't opened when the top of a file was empty has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where `printf` specifiers that contained dots were miscolored has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where all opens were considered unused inside of a recursive module has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Autocompletion for attributes now only suggests options that are actually attributes, contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Signature Help tooltips are now generated for Type Provider static parameters at the constructor call site, contributed by[Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where value types used as units of measure were colored as reference types has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where semantic colorization could disappear for some files while scrolling has been fixed by  [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
There is now an experimental CodeLens implementation, contributed by [Victor Peter Rouven Müller](https://github.com/realvictorprm). You can turn it on in **Options > Text Editor > F# > Code Lens**.
* A bug where the F# compiler service would incorrectly elide the module names in XML documentation has been fixed by [Sebastian Urban](https://github.com/surban).
* Code that uses `Dictionary` with `ContainsKey` and subsequent `Item` calls has been changed to use `TryGetValue`, by [Eugene Auduchinok](https://github.com/auduchinok).
* [Jakob Majoka](https://github.com/majocha) also contributed in the process of consuming a different API for Tooltips.

#### Infrastructure, Packaging, and Open Source Improvements

We made the following enhancements to infrastructure, packaging, and our open source contribution experience:

* The F# compiler distributed with Visual Studio no longer installs as a singleton in the F# Compiler SDK location. It is now fully side-by-side with Visual Studio, meaning that side-by-side installations of Visual Studio wil finally have truly side-by-side F# tooling and language experiences.
* The FSharp.Core NuGet package is now signed.
* ETW logging has been added to the F# tools and compiler.
* The very large `control.fs`/`control.fsi` files in FSharp.Core have been split into `async.fs`/`async.fsi`, `event.fs`/`event.fsi`, `eventmodule.fs`/`eventmodule.fsi`, `mailbox.fs`/`mailbox.fsi`, and `observable.fs`/`observable.fsi`.
* We added .NET SDK-style versions of our project performance stress test artifacts.
* We removed Newtonsoft.json from our codebase, and you now have one less package downloaded for OSS contributors.
* We now use the latest versions of System.Collections.Immutable and System.Reflection.Metadata.

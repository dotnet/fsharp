    Isolated Directory.Build.targets for CompilerCompat test projects.
    This prevents importing the repository root's build configuration, ensuring isolated build environments.
    
    We import UseLocalCompiler here (after SDK targets have been imported) rather than in .props
    to ensure the Build target exists before UseLocalCompiler props are applied.

  <!-- Import UseLocalCompiler props when testing with local compiler -->

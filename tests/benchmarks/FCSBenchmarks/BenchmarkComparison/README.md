# BenchmarkComparison

## What is it

* A meta-benchmark that compares performance between versions of the FCS codebase for a single-file codebase.
* Notebook-based, see `runner.ipynb`.
* Specified versions of FCS are downloaded from GitHub, built and benchmarked.
* Individual runs involve running a BDN benchmark in a separate process.
* Each run tests `FSharpChecker.ParseAndCheckFileInProject` on a single file (see `decentlySizedStandAloneFile.fs`).

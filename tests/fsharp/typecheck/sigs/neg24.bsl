neg24.fs(70,15,70,18): typecheck error FS0495: The member or object constructor 'M' has no argument or settable return property 'qez'. The required signature is member C.M : abc:int * def:string -> int.

neg24.fs(300,29,300,30): typecheck error FS0020: The result of this expression has type 'int' and is implicitly ignored. Consider using 'ignore' to discard this value explicitly, e.g. 'expr |> ignore', or 'let' to bind the result to a name, e.g. 'let result = expr'.

neg24.fs(309,31,309,32): typecheck error FS0001: This 'if' expression is missing an 'else' branch. Because 'if' is an expression, and not a statement, add an 'else' branch which also returns a value of type 'int'.

neg37.fs(19,33,19,40): typecheck error FS1125: The instantiation of the generic type 'CCC' is missing and can't be inferred from the arguments or return type of this member. Consider providing a type instantiation when accessing this type, e.g. 'CCC<_>'.

neg37.fs(24,10,24,37): typecheck error FS0331: The implicit instantiation of a generic construct at or near this point could not be resolved because it could resolve to multiple unrelated types, e.g. 'IComparable <'T>' and 'IEvent <'T>'. Consider using type annotations to resolve the ambiguity

neg56_a.fs(11,35,11,47): typecheck error FS1125: The instantiation of the generic type 'list1' is missing and can't be inferred from the arguments or return type of this member. Consider providing a type instantiation when accessing this type, e.g. 'list1<_>'.

neg56_a.fs(15,18,15,33): typecheck error FS3068: The function or member 'toList' is used in a way that requires further type annotations at its definition to ensure consistency of inferred types. The inferred signature is 'static member private list1.toList: ('a list1 -> 'a list)'.

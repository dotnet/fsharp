test2.fsx(148,13,148,52): typecheck error FS3235: A Span or IsByRefLike value returned from the expression cannot be used at ths point. This is to ensure the address of the local value does not escape its scope.

test2.fsx(152,21,152,84): typecheck error FS3233: The function or method call cannot be used at this point, because one argument that is a byref of a non-stack-local Span or IsByRefLike type is used with another argument that is a stack-local Span or IsByRefLike type. This is to ensure the address of the local value does not escape its scope.

test2.fsx(198,13,198,19): typecheck error FS3229: This value can't be assigned because the target 'x' may refer to non-stack-local memory, while the expression being assigned is assessed to potentially refer to stack-local memory. This is to help prevent pointers to stack-bound memory escaping their scope.

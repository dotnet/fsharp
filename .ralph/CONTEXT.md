## Sprint 2: Flip test expectations

**Summary:** Verified - no changes needed. Sprint 1 already correctly configured all test expectations:
- Example 2 (t vs Option<t>): already `shouldSucceed`
- Example 5 (partial concreteness): already `shouldSucceed`  
- Example 6 (incomparable): correctly `shouldFail`
- Example 7 (ValueTask): already `shouldSucceed`
- Example 8 (CE Source): already `shouldSucceed`

**Verification:** Build succeeded, 91/91 tiebreaker tests passing.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 2 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Flip test expectations: After Sprint 1 fixes the algorithm, update
   TiebreakerTests.fs to flip tests from `shouldFail |> withErrorCode 41` to `shouldSucceed` for:
   1) Example 2 (t vs Option<t>), 2) Example 5 partial concreteness cases, 3) Example 7 ValueTask
   scenario, 4) Example 8 CE Source pattern. Keep Example 6 (incomparable Result<int,'e> vs
   Result<'t,string>) as shouldFail since those are truly incomparable by design. Run tiebreaker
   tests to verify all pass.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- All tiebreaker tests pass
- No tests use shouldFail except for truly incomparable cases (Example 6)
- Example 2,5,7,8
   tests now expect shouldSucceed

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 11 is actually complete.

Migrate
   Conformance/LexicalAnalysis: Migrate the LexicalAnalysis test folders (~180
   tests). Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass, delete
    fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/LexicalAnalysis/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~LexicalAnalysis' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/LexicalAnalysis is empty or deleted
- Git commit made with
   descriptive message

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

SPRINT 1: Write failing test

Create a test in NullableReferenceTypesTests.fs that reproduces the exact issue
   from #18488: when matching a nullable type with `| null -> ...`, the variable in subsequent
   branches should be refined to non-null. The test should use patterns like: `type objnull = obj |
    null; let getEnvAliasObj (_: string) : objnull = failwith "stub"; let valueAliasObj = match
   getEnvAliasObj "ENVVAR" with | null -> "missing" | x -> x.ToString()`. This test should
   verify no nullness warning is emitted for `x.ToString()` since x is known non-null after the
   null case. Also test with `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` pattern.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Test
   file compiles
- Test fails when run against main branch (demonstrating the issue exists)
- Test correctly expects no nullness warnings in non-null branches

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

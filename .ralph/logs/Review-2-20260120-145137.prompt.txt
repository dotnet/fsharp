Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 2 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Analyze ResolveOverloading Hot Path: Deep-dive into ConstraintSolver.fs ResolveOverloading function (line 3438) using trace data.
   Identify which sub-operations consume the most time: FilterEachThenUndo,
   CanMemberSigsMatchUpToCheck, TypesEquiv, CalledMeth construction. Count how many candidates are
   tried vs how many succeed. Measure allocation patterns with dotnet-dump. Update
   METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md with findings and prioritize optimization ideas based on data.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Trace analysis shows time breakdown per sub-operation
- Candidate count statistics
   documented (tried vs succeeded)
- Allocation hotspots identified
- At least 3 optimization
   ideas prioritized based on data
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md updated with analysis
   findings

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

=== SHARED CONTEXT ===
Read .ralph/CONTEXT.md to see what previous subtasks accomplished.
Read .ralph/LAST_VALIDATOR.md to see the last validation result.

Implement subtask 13: Migrate
   Conformance/Expressions

Migrate the Expressions test folders (~380 tests).
   This is the largest Conformance package. Subfolders include ApplicationExpressions,
   ConstantExpressions, ControlFlowExpressions, DataExpressions, ExpressionQuotations, and others.
   May need multiple commits. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify
    tests pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Reference:
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/Expressions/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~Expressions' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/Expressions is empty or deleted
- Git commit(s) made with
   descriptive messages

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    VERIFY_FAILED

   **Summary:**
   - **Build**: ✅ Succeeded (compilation completed)
   - **Tests**: ❌ Failed with 324 errors out of 6227 total tests

   **Classification:**
   ```
   TestFailure:
     Command: ./build.sh -c Release --testcoreclr


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

You are an architect. Break this request into independently verifiable subtasks.

REQUEST: Check existing .ralph folder and contents in it. VISION.md tells what the goal was. status.txt tells you what happened so far. The full original instructions are at /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and include pointers to other files which you shall use during planning and when giving subtasks - the subtask instruction shall always receive pointer to those supportive .md files mentioned in FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md. Figure out from the status.txt what happened and how to continue. Also do check contents of the fsharpqa directory to make a good plan for the REMAINING work, and maybe create subtasks to verify that existing implementation was indeed done correctly, matches instructions, and cleaned up files,folder,.lsl files from fsharpqa folder after migrated. When executing the new tests, do make use of the BUILDING_USING_DOTNET set to true (to allow dotnet test and dotnet build, use Debug and net10 tfm) and SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK set to 1 so that you do not get langversion errors which are preexisting without this env var

GUIDELINES:
- Aim for 8-16 subtasks (fewer for simple tasks, more for complex ones)
- Each subtask should be completable in one focused session
- Each subtask MUST have clear, objective verificationCriteria
- Verification criteria should be concrete: 'file X exists', 'command Y succeeds', 'test Z passes'
- Subtasks run sequentially - later ones can depend on earlier ones
- Don't split artificially - only split where there's a natural boundary

First, analyze the codebase thoroughly.
Check .ralph/ folder for any previous attempts (VISION.md, logs, PROBLEMS.md).

Then create or update .ralph/VISION.md with:
- High-level goal and approach
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Important context for subtasks
- Any constraints or gotchas discovered
- Lessons learned from previous attempts (if any)

Finally, output JSON with the subtasks:

```json
{"overview": "approach", "subtasks": [{"id": 1, "title": "short title", "description": "detailed description of what to do", "verificationCriteria": ["specific check 1", "specific check 2"]}]}
```

Each verificationCriteria should be a concrete, testable statement like:
- 'File src/utils/helper.ts exists and exports function parseConfig'
- 'Running npm test passes with 0 failures'
- 'The function handles empty input without throwing'

Output PLAN_COMPLETE when done.

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPT DETECTED ===
The .ralph/ folder contains data from a previous run.

*** REPLAN REQUESTED ***
A subtask requested replanning. Read .ralph/REPLAN.md for details.
Address the concerns raised and create an improved plan.

PREVIOUS VISION (.ralph/VISION.md exists):
- Read it to understand what was tried before
- You may UPDATE it, REPLACE it, or keep it

PREVIOUS LOGS: 90 log files in .ralph/logs/
- Review them to understand what worked and what failed
- You may DELETE old logs if starting fresh

You have full control: learn from the past or start fresh.

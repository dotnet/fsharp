*** REVIEW ITERATION 2 - Previous reviews found issues ***
Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for context.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 2 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Import C# extension methods: Migrate ~9 C# extension method import tests from
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Import/em_csharp_*.fs to
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Import/ImportTests.fs. Original files include
   em_csharp_class_nonvoid.fs, em_csharp_class_params.fs, em_csharp_class_void.fs,
   em_csharp_on_fsharp_1.fs, em_csharp_on_fsharp_2.fs, em_csharp_struct_nonvoid.fs,
   em_csharp_struct_params.fs, em_csharp_struct_void.fs. Use CSharp helper with extension method
   definitions and verify F# can consume them on both struct and class types. View originals with
   `git show origin/main:tests/fsharpqa/Source/Import/em_csharp_*.fs`.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds
   with 0 errors
- All existing Import tests still pass
- New C# extension method tests pass
- Coverage: All em_csharp_* scenarios covered (struct, class, void, nonvoid, params)
- Tests
   added to existing ImportTests.fs module

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

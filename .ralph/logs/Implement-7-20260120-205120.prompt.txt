SPRINT 7: Comprehensive Testing and Validation

Run the full F# compiler test suite to
   ensure no regressions. Focus on overload resolution edge cases: generic methods, param arrays,
   optional parameters, named arguments, type-directed conversions, extension methods. Run
   benchmarks comparing original vs optimized compiler on the test project. Document final
   performance improvement.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Full test suite passes: dotnet build -c Release && dotnet
   test -c Release
- Edge case tests explicitly verified passing
- Benchmark comparison: original
    vs optimized on 1500-assertion project
- At least 50% improvement in untyped Assert.Equal
   compilation time
- No semantic changes to overload resolution (same method selected)
- Results
    documented in METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

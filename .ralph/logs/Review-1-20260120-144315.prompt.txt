Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 1 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Profiling Infrastructure Setup: Set up and verify the
   profiling infrastructure using dotnet-trace and the existing tools/perf-repro/ scripts. Install
   dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump, and dotnet-counters. Generate test projects with
   GenerateXUnitPerfTest.fsx (1500 Assert.Equal calls, 10 methods). Collect baseline traces for
   both untyped (slow) and typed (fast) versions. Convert traces to speedscope format and analyze
   hot paths. Document baseline metrics in METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump, dotnet-counters installed and working
- Test projects generated in
    tools/perf-repro/generated/
- Baseline traces collected for untyped and typed versions
- Baseline timing documented: untyped build time, typed build time, ratio
- Hot path methods
   identified from trace analysis
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Experiment 1 section updated
   with results

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

Implement subtask 7: Migrate override and quotation tests

Move W_OverrideImplementationInAugmentation01a.fs,
   W_OverrideImplementationInAugmentation02b.fs, W_OverrideImplementationInAugmentation03a.fs,
   W_OverrideImplementationInAugmentation03b.fs, E_Quotation_UnresolvedGenericConstruct01.fs,
   E_InvalidObjectExpression01.fs. Add test methods.

Criteria:
- 6 files moved to
   resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 6 test methods in General.fs
- W_ prefix tests use
   shouldSucceed with warning checks if --warnaserror not set

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

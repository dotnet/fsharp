Implement subtask 10: Migrate
   Conformance/ImplementationFilesAndSignatureFiles

Migrate the
   ImplementationFilesAndSignatureFiles test folders (~69 tests). These may involve multi-file
   compilation (fsi+fs pairs). Use withAdditionalSourceFile pattern. Parse env.lst, create test
   files, git-move source files, verify tests pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Reference:
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ImplementationFilesAndSignatureFiles/
- Command 'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~ImplementationFilesAndSignatureFiles' passes
   or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ImplementationFilesAndSignatureFiles is empty or deleted
- Git commit made with descriptive message

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

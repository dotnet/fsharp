Implement subtask 2: Migrate ComponentTests Conformance files

Migrate 9 files in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ subdirs:
-
   UseBindings/UseBindings.fs (withLangVersion60)
-
   LexicalFiltering/OffsideExceptions/OffsideExceptions.fs (withLangVersion50,
   withLangVersion60)
- Types/TypeConstraints/IWSAMsAndSRTPs/IWSAMsAndSRTPsTests.fs
   (withLangVersion70, withLangVersion60)
- Types/UnionTypes/UnionStructTypes.fs
   (withLangVersion70)
- Types/UnionTypes/UnionTypes.fs (withLangVersion70, withLangVersion60)
-
   BasicGrammarElements/StaticLet/StaticLetInUnionsAndRecords.fs (withLangVersion70)
-
   BasicGrammarElements/MemberDefinitions/MethodsAndProperties/MethodsAndProperties.fs
   (withLangVersion70)
- PatternMatching/As/As.fs (withLangVersion60)
-
   InferenceProcedures/RecursiveSafetyAnalysis/RecursiveSafetyAnalysis.fs (raw langversion
   string)

Replace all old langversions with withLangVersion80.

Criteria:
- grep
    -n 'withLangVersion(46|47|50|60|70)' tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/**/*.fs
   returns 0 matches
- SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet build
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests exits 0

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

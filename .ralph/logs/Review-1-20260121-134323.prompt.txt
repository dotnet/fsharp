TypeExtensions/optional tests: Migrate ~22 optional type
   extension tests from
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/TypeExtensions/optional/ to
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/TypeExtensions/op
   tional/Optional.fs. These test cross-assembly extension members on types from external DLLs.
   Original files include typeext_opt001-008.fs, E_typeext_opt005.fs, E_CrossModule01.fs,
   E_ModuleNotOpen.fs, E_NotInModule.fs, E_PrivateFields.fs, ShortNamesAllowed.fs. Use `git show
   origin/main:<path>` to view original test content. Create helper library compilations (lib000.fs
    through lib005.fs) and test both success and error scenarios for instance extensions, static
   extensions, properties, and cross-assembly access patterns.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds:
   ./build.sh -c Release builds without errors
- Tests pass: dotnet test --filter
   'FullyQualifiedName~TypeExtensions.Optional' passes all new tests
- Coverage: All 22 original
   optional extension scenarios migrated
- No duplication: Helper library patterns reused across
   tests
- Correct location: Tests in TypeExtensions/optional/ subfolder

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

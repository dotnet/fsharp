Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 4 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Implement Quick Type Compatibility Check: Add a fast-path type compatibility check before full unification in
   FilterEachThenUndo. For each candidate, perform a quick structural comparison of caller arg
   types vs callee param types - if they're obviously incompatible (e.g., caller has int but callee
    expects IComparer with no generic match possible), skip full type checking. Must still handle
   type-directed conversions, generics, and param arrays correctly.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Quick compatibility
   check added before CanMemberSigsMatchUpToCheck
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing
   compiler tests pass
- Test cases cover: generics, param arrays, optional args, type-directed
   conversions
- Profiling shows additional speedup beyond arity filtering
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 4 updated with results

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

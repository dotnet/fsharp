Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 4 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Add language feature flag: Add
   preview/stable language feature for the tiebreaker: 1) Add
   LanguageFeature.MoreConcreteTiebreaker to Features.fs, 2) Gate the new code in better() with
   g.langVersion.SupportsFeature check, 3) Initially set to preview in F# 9.0 or stable in 10.0
   (check current version). This allows the feature to be turned off if regressions are found. Run
   full build to verify integration.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- LanguageFeature.MoreConcreteTiebreaker defined
- Tiebreaker code is gated behind feature
   check
- Tests still pass with feature enabled by default for net10.0

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 1 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Verification: Run full test suite: Run the full component test suite
   to verify the 93 tiebreaker tests still pass and no regressions were introduced. Verify the
   build succeeds with zero warnings. This sprint confirms the baseline quality of the
   implementation.

Steps:
1. Build the compiler: dotnet build
   src/Compiler/FSharp.Compiler.Service.fsproj -c Debug
2. Run tiebreaker tests: dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests.fsproj --filter
   "FullyQualifiedName~Tiebreakers" -c Debug
3. Verify 93 tests pass
4. Check formatting:
   dotnet fantomas . --check

No code changes expected - this is a verification sprint.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- 93/93 tiebreaker tests pass
- Formatting check passes (dotnet
    fantomas . --check)

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

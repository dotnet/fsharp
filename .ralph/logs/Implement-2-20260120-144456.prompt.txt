SPRINT 2: Analyze ResolveOverloading Hot Path

Deep-dive into ConstraintSolver.fs ResolveOverloading function (line 3438) using trace data.
   Identify which sub-operations consume the most time: FilterEachThenUndo,
   CanMemberSigsMatchUpToCheck, TypesEquiv, CalledMeth construction. Count how many candidates are
   tried vs how many succeed. Measure allocation patterns with dotnet-dump. Update
   METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md with findings and prioritize optimization ideas based on data.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Trace analysis shows time breakdown per sub-operation
- Candidate count statistics
   documented (tried vs succeeded)
- Allocation hotspots identified
- At least 3 optimization
   ideas prioritized based on data
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md updated with analysis
   findings

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

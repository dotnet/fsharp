You are an architect. Break this request into independently verifiable subtasks.

REQUEST: You got stuck, check .ralph folder and replan. You we working on fsharpqa migration defined in a separate .md file for it. Make sure to use SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK env var set to 1 when running tests. The migration was in solid progress, .ralph folder contents should tell you then. Check what was needed, what was done - it is all commited AND unpushed. Replan and continue

GUIDELINES:
- Aim for 8-16 subtasks (fewer for simple tasks, more for complex ones)
- Each subtask should be completable in one focused session
- Each subtask MUST have clear, objective verificationCriteria
- Verification criteria should be concrete: 'file X exists', 'command Y succeeds', 'test Z passes'
- Subtasks run sequentially - later ones can depend on earlier ones
- Don't split artificially - only split where there's a natural boundary

First, analyze the codebase thoroughly.
Check .ralph/ folder for any previous attempts (VISION.md, logs, PROBLEMS.md).

Then create or update .ralph/VISION.md with:
- High-level goal and approach
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Important context for subtasks
- Any constraints or gotchas discovered
- Lessons learned from previous attempts (if any)

Finally, output JSON with the subtasks:

```json
{"overview": "approach", "subtasks": [{"id": 1, "title": "short title", "description": "detailed description of what to do", "verificationCriteria": ["specific check 1", "specific check 2"]}]}
```

Each verificationCriteria should be a concrete, testable statement like:
- 'File src/utils/helper.ts exists and exports function parseConfig'
- 'Running npm test passes with 0 failures'
- 'The function handles empty input without throwing'

Output PLAN_COMPLETE when done.

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPT DETECTED ===
The .ralph/ folder contains data from a previous run.

*** REPLAN REQUESTED ***
A subtask requested replanning. Read .ralph/REPLAN.md for details.
Address the concerns raised and create an improved plan.

PREVIOUS VISION (.ralph/VISION.md exists):
- Read it to understand what was tried before
- You may UPDATE it, REPLACE it, or keep it

PREVIOUS LOGS: 2 log files in .ralph/logs/
- Review them to understand what worked and what failed
- You may DELETE old logs if starting fresh

You have full control: learn from the past or start fresh.

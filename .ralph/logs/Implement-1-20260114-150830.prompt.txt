Implement subtask 1: Create
   tracking documents

Create MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md and
   TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/ to track issues discovered
   during migration. These will document tests that cannot be migrated and framework features that
   need to be added. Reference FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md Part 2 for format.

Criteria:
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md exists with proper markdown
   header
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md exists with
   proper markdown header
- Both files have placeholder sections for tracking issues

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

Implement subtask 2: Migrate E_matrix and E_expression files

Move E_matrix_class01.fs, E_matrix_interface01.fs, E_matrix_LetBinding01.fs,
   E_matrix_struct01.fs, E_ExpressionHasType_FullPath01.fs, and
   W_GenericTypeProvideATypeInstantiation01.fs using git mv. Add test methods to General.fs. These
   test FS0001 type errors.

Criteria:
- 6 files moved to
   resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 6 corresponding test methods in General.fs
- Each test
   uses shouldFail with appropriate error codes

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

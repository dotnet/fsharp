Implement subtask 14: Migrate Conformance/TypeForwarding

Migrate the TypeForwarding test folders (~303 tests): Interface, Cycle,
   Delegate, Struct, Class, Nested. These tests involve C# interop and type forwarding - may
   require CSharp compilation helpers. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source
   files, verify tests pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Document any blockers in
   MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/TypeForwarding/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~TypeForwarding' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/TypeForwarding is empty or deleted (or blockers documented)
- Git commit(s) made with descriptive messages

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    **VERIFY_FAILED**

   Test summary: 307 tests failed (vs ~294 expected pre-existing failures per VISION.md).
   - Total tests: 6237
   - Failed: 307
   - Succeeded: 5654
   - Skipped: 276

   The build itself succeeded, but there are 13 more test failures than the documented baseline of
   ~294. This could indicate either:


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

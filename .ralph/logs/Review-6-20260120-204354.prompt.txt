Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 6 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Implement Overload Resolution Caching: Design and implement a cache for
   overload resolution results. Key: (method group identity, caller argument types). Value:
   resolved CalledMeth or failure. Scope cache appropriately (per-file or per-expression-check
   context). Handle cache invalidation when types are refined during inference. Measure cache hit
   rate and overall speedup for repetitive patterns like test files with many Assert.Equal calls.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Cache design documented in METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md
- Cache implementation
   added to ConstraintSolver.fs or CheckExpressions.fs
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All
   existing compiler tests pass
- Cache hit rate measured on test project (target: >30% for
   repetitive patterns)
- Overall speedup measured and documented
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 2 updated with results

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

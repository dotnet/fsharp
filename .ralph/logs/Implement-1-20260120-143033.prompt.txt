SPRINT 1: Profiling Infrastructure Setup

Set up and verify the
   profiling infrastructure using dotnet-trace and the existing tools/perf-repro/ scripts. Install
   dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump, and dotnet-counters. Generate test projects with
   GenerateXUnitPerfTest.fsx (1500 Assert.Equal calls, 10 methods). Collect baseline traces for
   both untyped (slow) and typed (fast) versions. Convert traces to speedscope format and analyze
   hot paths. Document baseline metrics in METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump, dotnet-counters installed and working
- Test projects generated in
    tools/perf-repro/generated/
- Baseline traces collected for untyped and typed versions
- Baseline timing documented: untyped build time, typed build time, ratio
- Hot path methods
   identified from trace analysis
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Experiment 1 section updated
   with results

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

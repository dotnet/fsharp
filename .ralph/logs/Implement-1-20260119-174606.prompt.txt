SPRINT 1: Fix core algorithm

The
   current implementation in ConstraintSolver.fs lines 3853-3866 compares `candidate.CalledTyArgs`
   (instantiated method type arguments) but should compare parameter types. Fix by: 1) Change from
   comparing CalledTyArgs to comparing AllUnnamedCalledArgs parameter types, 2) Use
   compareTypeConcreteness on each CalledArgumentType, 3) Apply dominance aggregation. After fix,
   Example 2 ('t vs Option<'t>) and Examples 5/7/8 (partial concreteness) should resolve. Run:
   dotnet test tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests.fsproj --filter
   "FullyQualifiedName~Tiebreakers" -c Debug -f net10.0

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- 91 tiebreaker tests still pass
- Tests comparing 't vs Option<'t> now resolve (flip test
   expectations)
- Tests comparing Result<int,'e> vs Result<'ok,'e> now resolve

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

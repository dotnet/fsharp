SPRINT 3: FamAndAssembly accessibility
   tests

Migrate 4 FamAndAssembly (protected internal) accessibility tests from
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Import/. Files: FamAndAssembly.fs (with IVT), FamAndAssembly_NoIVT.fs,
   FamOrAssembly.fs, FamOrAssembly_NoIVT.fs. These test F# access to C# 'private protected' and
   'protected internal' members with and without InternalsVisibleTo. One test already exists
   (FamAndAssembly with IVT) - add the remaining 3 scenarios including error cases where access
   should fail without IVT.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- All existing Import tests
   pass
- New FamAndAssembly/FamOrAssembly tests pass
- Coverage: Both IVT and NoIVT scenarios
   for both accessibility levels
- Error tests verify correct access denial without IVT

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

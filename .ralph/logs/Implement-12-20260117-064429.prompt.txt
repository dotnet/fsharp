Implement subtask 12: Migrate Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions

Migrate the ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions test folders (~356 tests):
   InterfaceTypes, ClassTypes (multiple subfolders), AbstractMembers, TypeKindInference, EnumTypes,
    DelegateTypes, StructTypes, TypeExtensions. This is a large package - may need multiple
   commits. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass,
   delete fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/
- Command
   'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions' passes or skips
   gracefully
- Directory tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions is empty
    or deleted
- Git commit(s) made with descriptive messages

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    VERIFY_FAILED

   **Classification: TestFailure (Pre-existing)**
   - Command: `./build.sh -c Release --testcoreclr`
   - ExitCode: 1
   - Test Summary: total: 6077, failed: 307, succeeded: 5514, skipped: 256
   - Build: Succeeded
   - Tests: 307 failures (consistent with documented 294-307 pre-existing baseline)
   - Categories: langversion compatibility tests, OffsideExceptions indentation warnings, FSI
   session limitations


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

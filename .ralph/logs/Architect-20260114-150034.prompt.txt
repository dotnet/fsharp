You are an architect. Break this request into MANY small, independently verifiable subtasks.

REQUEST: Check FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md. Make sure subagents receive context as pointers to important files by name - the initial spec lists those file and they will be a means of communication.  Establish a robust process for implementing that via a massive series of small subtasks. Optimize for easy of review (file moves a lot better then file edits) and reusing whatever is provided in TestUtilities and especially Compiler.fs helper file

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Create as many subtasks as needed - 20, 30, even 50 is fine
- Each subtask should be SMALL and completable in one focused session
- Each subtask MUST have clear, objective verificationCriteria
- Verification criteria should be concrete: 'file X exists', 'command Y succeeds', 'test Z passes'
- Subtasks run sequentially - later ones can depend on earlier ones
- When in doubt, split into smaller pieces

First, analyze the codebase thoroughly.
Check .ralph/ folder for any previous attempts (VISION.md, logs, PROBLEMS.md).

Then create or update .ralph/VISION.md with:
- High-level goal and approach
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Important context for subtasks
- Any constraints or gotchas discovered
- Lessons learned from previous attempts (if any)

Finally, output JSON with the subtasks:

```json
{"overview": "approach", "subtasks": [{"id": 1, "title": "short title", "description": "detailed description of what to do", "verificationCriteria": ["specific check 1", "specific check 2"]}]}
```

Each verificationCriteria should be a concrete, testable statement like:
- 'File src/utils/helper.ts exists and exports function parseConfig'
- 'Running npm test passes with 0 failures'
- 'The function handles empty input without throwing'

Output PLAN_COMPLETE when done.

=== PREVIOUS ATTEMPT DETECTED ===
The .ralph/ folder contains data from a previous run.

PREVIOUS LOGS: 21 log files in .ralph/logs/
- Review them to understand what worked and what failed
- You may DELETE old logs if starting fresh

You have full control: learn from the past or start fresh.

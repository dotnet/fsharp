Implement subtask 1: Migrate
   W_redefineOperator files

Move W_redefineOperator03.fs through
   W_redefineOperator10.fs (6 files) from tests/fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics/General/ to
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/ using git mv. Add
   corresponding test methods to General.fs following the existing pattern (withOptions
   ["--test:ErrorRanges"; "-a"], typecheck, shouldSucceed with warning). Parse each file's
   <Expects> to determine the correct assertions.

Criteria:
- Files
   W_redefineOperator03.fs through W_redefineOperator10.fs exist in
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 6 new test methods
   added to General.fs for these files
- git status shows the files as renamed (not
   deleted+added)

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

SPRINT 3: Add diagnostics FS35xx

Implement optional diagnostics per RFC section-diagnostics.md: 1) Find available warning
   numbers in FS35xx range (FS3570 is taken by tcAmbiguousDiscardDotLambda), try FS3575/FS3576, 2)
   Add entries to FSComp.txt: 3575,tcMoreConcreteTiebreakerUsed and 3576,tcGenericOverloadBypassed,
    3) Add warning emission in ConstraintSolver.fs better() when concreteness tiebreaker selects a
   winner, 4) Register in CompilerDiagnostics.fs as off by default, 5) Add test that enables
   warning and verifies emission. Run: dotnet build src/Compiler -c Debug

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds
    with 0 errors
- FSComp.txt contains new warning entries
- CompilerDiagnostics.fs registers
   warnings as off by default
- Warning can be enabled with --warnon:3575
- Test verifies warning
    text when enabled

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

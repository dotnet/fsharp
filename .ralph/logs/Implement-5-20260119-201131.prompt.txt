SPRINT 5: Migrate PRECMD dependency tests

Migrate ~20 tests that used PRECMD to
   pre-compile dependencies. The audit confirms the References mechanism already handles this.
1.
   Find tests using PRECMD/FSC_PIPE in git history
2. Convert to use withReferences [dependency]
   pattern
3. This includes tests in Conformance that required pre-compiled libs

Reference
   VERIFICATION_v3_SuspiciousItems.md 'BLOCKER 4: PRECMD tests require pre-compilation steps'.

Verification Criteria:
- Build succeeds: dotnet build tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests
- Tests pass for migrated PRECMD tests
- At least 15 PRECMD-style tests migrated using
   References

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment:
1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. The feature must work as specified

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL criteria are met (including tests passing), COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

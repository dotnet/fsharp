Implement subtask 12: Migrate Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions

Migrate the ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions test folders (~356 tests):
   InterfaceTypes, ClassTypes (multiple subfolders), AbstractMembers, TypeKindInference, EnumTypes,
    DelegateTypes, StructTypes, TypeExtensions. This is a large package - may need multiple
   commits. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass,
   delete fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/
- Command
   'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions' passes or skips
   gracefully
- Directory tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions is empty
    or deleted
- Git commit(s) made with descriptive messages

FIX THESE ISSUES:
- **InterfaceTypes.fs is commented out** in the fsproj - tests exist but aren't executed
- **14 env.lst files remain** in
- **No git commit** for ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions migration (recent commits are for other
- **Multiple categories still have tests in fsharpqa**:
- InterfaceTypes: ~40+ tests including C# interop tests
- ClassTypes/ImplicitObjectConstructors: 1 test
- ClassTypes/AsDeclarations: 2 tests
- ClassTypes/LetDoDeclarations: 1 WPF test
- ClassTypes/InheritsDeclarations: 8 tests (many C# interop)
- ClassTypes/MemberDeclarations: ~30 tests (many C# interop)
- ClassTypes/ValueRestriction: 2 tests
- AbstractMembers: ~15 tests (many C# interop)
- DelegateTypes: 6 tests (1 C# interop)
- TypeExtensions/basic: ~24 tests (some C# interop)
- TypeExtensions/intrinsic: 5 multi-file tests
- TypeExtensions/optional: 17 tests with library dependencies
- **Criteria check**:
- ❌ Tests exist but InterfaceTypes.fs is **commented out** - not running
- ⚠️ 190 tests pass but fsharpqa folder has 14 env.lst files remaining
- ❌ Directory `tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions` is NOT
- ❌ No git commit for ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions migration found


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

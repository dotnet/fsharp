Implement subtask 6: Migrate
   DIAG-GENERAL package (part 2: next 25)

Continue migration of tests 26-50 from
   Diagnostics/General/. Add to existing General.fs file.

Criteria:
- At least 50
   source files total in resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- File Diagnostics/General.fs has
   50+ test methods
- dotnet build tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests succeeds

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

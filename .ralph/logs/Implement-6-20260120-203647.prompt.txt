SPRINT 6: Implement Overload Resolution Caching

Design and implement a cache for
   overload resolution results. Key: (method group identity, caller argument types). Value:
   resolved CalledMeth or failure. Scope cache appropriately (per-file or per-expression-check
   context). Handle cache invalidation when types are refined during inference. Measure cache hit
   rate and overall speedup for repetitive patterns like test files with many Assert.Equal calls.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Cache design documented in METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md
- Cache implementation
   added to ConstraintSolver.fs or CheckExpressions.fs
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All
   existing compiler tests pass
- Cache hit rate measured on test project (target: >30% for
   repetitive patterns)
- Overall speedup measured and documented
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 2 updated with results

FIX THESE ISSUES:
- FAILED: All existing compiler tests pass (baseline was not updated before review)
- ISSUES:
- The SurfaceArea baseline file was not updated with the new public API entries for
- **Fixed now**: Baseline has been updated and SurfaceArea test passes
- The TypeCheckerRecoveryTests.Tuple02 failure is pre-existing and unrelated to Sprint 6


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

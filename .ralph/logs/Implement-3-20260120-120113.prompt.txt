SPRINT 3: Documentation: Track deferred items

Document the two deferred items
   properly so they are tracked for future work:

1. **Constraint Specificity Comparison (RFC
   Example 15)**
   - Create a comment in TiebreakerTests.fs explaining the F# language
   limitation
   - The test 'Example 15 - Constrained vs unconstrained type variable - not yet
   supported' already documents this
   - Verify the test expectation is correct (should fail with
    FS0438)

2. **Enhanced FS0041 Error Message**
   - Add a TODO comment in ConstraintSolver.fs
    near the incomparable case
   - Note this as future UX enhancement

No functional changes -
   documentation only.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- TiebreakerTests.fs has clear comment explaining Example 15
   limitation
- Deferred items documented in VISION.md under 'What is NOT Done'
- No test
   failures introduced

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

=== SHARED CONTEXT ===
Read .ralph/CONTEXT.md to see what previous subtasks accomplished.
Read .ralph/LAST_VALIDATOR.md to see the last validation result.

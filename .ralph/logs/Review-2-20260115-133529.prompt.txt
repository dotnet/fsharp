Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 2 is actually complete.

Migrate ComponentTests Conformance files: Migrate 9 files in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ subdirs:
-
   UseBindings/UseBindings.fs (withLangVersion60)
-
   LexicalFiltering/OffsideExceptions/OffsideExceptions.fs (withLangVersion50,
   withLangVersion60)
- Types/TypeConstraints/IWSAMsAndSRTPs/IWSAMsAndSRTPsTests.fs

   (withLangVersion70)
- PatternMatching/As/As.fs (withLangVersion60)
-
   InferenceProcedures/RecursiveSafetyAnalysis/RecursiveSafetyAnalysis.fs (raw langversion
   string)

Replace all old langversions with withLangVersion80.

Criteria:
- grep
    -n 'withLangVersion(46|47|50|60|70)' tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/**/*.fs
   returns 0 matches
- SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet build
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests exits 0

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

SPRINT 4: Add language feature flag

Add
   preview/stable language feature for the tiebreaker: 1) Add
   LanguageFeature.MoreConcreteTiebreaker to Features.fs, 2) Gate the new code in better() with
   g.langVersion.SupportsFeature check, 3) Initially set to preview in F# 9.0 or stable in 10.0
   (check current version). This allows the feature to be turned off if regressions are found. Run
   full build to verify integration.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- LanguageFeature.MoreConcreteTiebreaker defined
- Tiebreaker code is gated behind feature
   check
- Tests still pass with feature enabled by default for net10.0

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

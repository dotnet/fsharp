*** REVIEW ITERATION 2 - Previous reviews found issues ***
Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for context.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 1 is actually complete.

Create
   tracking documents: Create MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md and
   TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/ to track issues discovered
   during migration. These will document tests that cannot be migrated and framework features that
   need to be added. Reference FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md Part 2 for format.

Criteria:
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md exists with proper markdown
   header
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md exists with
   proper markdown header
- Both files have placeholder sections for tracking issues

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

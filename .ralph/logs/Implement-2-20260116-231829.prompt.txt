Implement subtask 2: Verify existing FSI
   langversion/nologo migration

Verify the CompilerOptions/fsi migrations
   (Langversion.fs, Nologo.fs) compile and pass tests. Run: BUILDING_USING_DOTNET=true
   SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet test tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests -c Debug -f
   net10.0 --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~CompilerOptions.fsi'. Confirm langversion and nologo
   folders are deleted from fsharpqa. Reference:
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md

Criteria:
- Files
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/CompilerOptions/fsi/Langversion.fs and Nologo.fs exist
- Command 'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~CompilerOptions.fsi' completes without build
   errors
- Directories tests/fsharpqa/Source/CompilerOptions/fsi/langversion and nologo do not
   exist

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    **VERIFY_FAILED**

   ```
   Classification: TestFailure
   Command: BUILDING_USING_DOTNET=true SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests -c Debug -f net10.0 --no-build
   ExitCode: 0 (misleading - tests ran but had failures)
   KeySnippets:
     - Failed: 61, Passed: 5185, Skipped: 229, Total: 5475

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

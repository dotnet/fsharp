*** REVIEW ITERATION 2 - Previous reviews found issues ***
Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for context.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 4 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Migrate
   FSIMODE=PIPE InteractiveSession tests: Migrate ~50 InteractiveSession tests
   that use FSIMODE=PIPE. The audit confirms runFsi already handles this - the team didn't try
   it.
1. Restore deleted tests from git history: git show 646276c18^ for files in
   InteractiveSession/Misc
2. Add tests to ComponentTests/InteractiveSession/Misc.fs or new
   files
3. Use existing Fsx + runFsi infrastructure
4. Focus on: fsi.CommandLineArgs tests (try
   FSharpScript with argv first), #r relative path tests, multi-file FSI tests

Reference
   VERIFICATION_v3_SuspiciousItems.md 'BLOCKER 1: FSIMODE=PIPE' and 'BLOCKER 6:
   fsi.CommandLineArgs'.

Verification Criteria:
- Build succeeds: dotnet build
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests
- Tests pass: dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~InteractiveSession' -c
   Release
- At least 30 additional InteractiveSession tests migrated

=== SPRINT REVIEW CHECKLIST ===
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL of these are true:
1. Build/compile succeeds without errors
2. All tests pass (new AND existing)
3. The feature works as specified
4. No TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
5. Implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

REJECT the sprint if tests are missing or failing.
REJECT the sprint if 'tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if the sprint delivers a complete, tested increment.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by bullet list of issues if not.

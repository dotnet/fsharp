Implement subtask 3: Migrate ComponentTests
   Diagnostics and Miscellaneous

Migrate files:
-
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Diagnostics/Records.fs (withLangVersion70)
-
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Miscellaneous/ListLiterals.fs (withLangVersion70,
   withLangVersion60)
-
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Miscellaneous/MigratedTypeCheckTests.fs (LangVersion.V50,
   V60, V70)
- tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Miscellaneous/FsharpSuiteMigrated.fs
   (LangVersion enum helper)
-
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Miscellaneous/MigratedCoreTests.fs (LangVersion.V50,
   V70)

Replace withLangVersionXX with withLangVersion80 and LangVersion.VXX with
   LangVersion.V80.

Criteria:
- grep -n 'withLangVersion(46|47|50|60|70)'
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Diagnostics/*.fs returns 0 matches
- grep -n
   'withLangVersion(46|47|50|60|70)' tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Miscellaneous/*.fs
   returns 0 matches
- grep -n 'LangVersion\.V(46|47|50|60|70)'
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Miscellaneous/*.fs returns 0 matches
- SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet build tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests exits 0

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

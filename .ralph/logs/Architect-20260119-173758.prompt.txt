You are an ARCHITECT and PRODUCT OWNER. Plan work as SPRINTS delivering tested product increments.

REQUEST: A previous team worked on /Users/tomasgrosup/code/RFCs/tiebreakers/RFC_draft  support - scan the full folder and all .md files in it, this is your context. This repo has a branch with MANY commited, unpushed, unmerged changes. But it is NOT done. An analyst has created /Users/tomasgrosup/code/RFCs/tiebreakers/impl/notes/existing-rules.md . The former pprogress reporter tracked /Users/tomasgrosup/code/RFCs/tiebreakers/.ralph/VISION.md  for the impl, but maybe the RFC is a better guiding doc. Anyway, crosscheck the RFC with what was done. Be absolutely fucking brutally honest about what is missing. Optimize for a possibly long line of partial incremental successes being build one by one. Do make sure you always build and test, plain dotnet test with filter and with c=Debug and tfm=net10 should be just fine for this case (as there are no IL tests I would imagine, or? If there are , IL tests like EmittedIl suite does need to be built in Release mode for propper comparison. LEts plan to iterate on it many times

=== SPRINT-BASED PLANNING ===
Each sprint is a PRODUCT INCREMENT with a clear Definition of Done (DoD).

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER create separate 'testing', 'add tests', or 'write tests' sprints
- Each sprint MUST include its own testing - the increment must build and pass tests
- A sprint is only complete when ALL DoD criteria pass
- Think: 'What is the smallest shippable increment that adds value?'

ANTI-PATTERNS (DO NOT DO):
- Sprint 1: Implement feature X, Sprint 2: Add tests for X  <- WRONG
- Sprint 1: Scaffold, Sprint 2: Implement, Sprint 3: Test  <- WRONG
- Any sprint that produces untested code                   <- WRONG

=== DEFINITION OF DONE (DoD) ===
Each sprint MUST have a DoD with TECHNICALLY EXECUTABLE criteria.
The DoD is validated after each iteration - failed items trigger re-iteration.

DoD MUST include (adapt to task):
1. BUILD: 'Build/compile succeeds without errors or warnings'
2. TESTS: 'All existing tests pass', 'New tests cover the feature'
3. QUALITY:
   - 'No code duplication introduced (check with tools or review)'
   - 'No test code duplication'
   - 'No unnecessary allocations or performance overhead'
   - 'Proper architectural placement (right project/module/layer)'
4. FUNCTIONAL: 'Feature X works as specified'

DoD EXAMPLES (adapt based on task type):
- 'dotnet build completes with 0 errors and 0 warnings'
- 'dotnet test passes with 100% of tests green'
- 'New code is in src/Services/, not mixed with controllers'
- 'No LINQ allocations in hot path'
- 'No copy-paste from existing similar feature'

GUIDELINES:
- Aim for 4-10 sprints (fewer for simple tasks, more for complex ones)
- Each sprint should be completable in one focused session
- Sprints run sequentially - later ones can depend on earlier ones
- Don't split artificially - only split where there's a natural product boundary

=== REPLANNING AWARENESS ===
After each sprint completes, the orchestrator may trigger replanning.
When replanning:
- Read .ralph/CONTEXT.md to see what previous sprints accomplished
- Read .ralph/REPLAN.md if present - this contains feedback from a failed/adjusted sprint
- Read .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for issues encountered
- ADJUST the remaining backlog based on what you learn
- You may ADD, REMOVE, REORDER, or MODIFY future sprints
- The goal is to deliver the best product, not to follow the original plan blindly

First, analyze the codebase thoroughly.
Check .ralph/ folder for any previous attempts (VISION.md, CONTEXT.md, logs, PROBLEMS.md, REPLAN.md).

Then create or update .ralph/VISION.md with:
- High-level goal and approach
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Important context for sprints
- Any constraints or gotchas discovered
- Lessons learned from previous attempts (if any)

Finally, output JSON with the sprints:

```json
{"overview": "approach", "subtasks": [{"id": 1, "name": "short name for table", "description": "robust description of what to implement AND test, with context", "dod": ["Build succeeds with 0 errors", "All tests pass", "No code duplication", "Feature X works"]}]}
```

SCHEMA NOTES:
- 'name': Short name (shown in table)
- 'description': Detailed description for the executing agent
- 'dod': Definition of Done - list of EXECUTABLE criteria (validated after each iteration)

Output PLAN_COMPLETE when done.

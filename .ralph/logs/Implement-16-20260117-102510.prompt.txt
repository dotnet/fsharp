Implement subtask 16: Migrate InteractiveSession

Migrate the InteractiveSession test folders (~169 tests). These are FSI tests
   that may require special handling. Check for FSIMODE settings and use appropriate test patterns
   (runFsi vs compile). Document any blockers. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move
   source files, verify tests pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Reference:
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/InteractiveSession/
- Command 'dotnet test --filter
   FullyQualifiedName~InteractiveSession' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/InteractiveSession is empty or deleted (or blockers documented)
- Git
   commit(s) made with descriptive messages

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

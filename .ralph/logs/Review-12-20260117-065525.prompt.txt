*** REVIEW ITERATION 2 - Previous reviews found issues ***
Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for context.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 12 is actually complete.

Migrate Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions: Migrate the ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions test folders (~356 tests):
   InterfaceTypes, ClassTypes (multiple subfolders), AbstractMembers, TypeKindInference, EnumTypes,
    DelegateTypes, StructTypes, TypeExtensions. This is a large package - may need multiple
   commits. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass,
   delete fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/
- Command
   'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions' passes or skips
   gracefully
- Directory tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions is empty
    or deleted
- Git commit(s) made with descriptive messages

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

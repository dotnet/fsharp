Implement subtask 8: Migrate Conformance/TypesAndTypeConstraints

Migrate the TypesAndTypeConstraints test folders (~96 tests):
   LogicalPropertiesOfTypes, CheckingSyntacticTypes, TypeParameterDefinitions, TypeConstraints.
   Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass, delete
   fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/TypesAndTypeConstraints/
- Command 'dotnet
    test --filter FullyQualifiedName~TypesAndTypeConstraints' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/TypesAndTypeConstraints is empty or deleted
- Git
   commit made with descriptive message

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    **VERIFY_FAILED**

   299 test failures in FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests (expected ~294 pre-existing). The 5
   additional failures are related to unsupported language version tests (`--langversion:5.0`,
   `--langversion:7.0`) which fail with Error 3879 "Language version 'X.0' is out of support".
   These are pre-existing test infrastructure issues, not caused by the fsharpqa migration work on
   this branch.




IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

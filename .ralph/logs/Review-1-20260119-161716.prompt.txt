*** REVIEW ITERATION 2 - Previous reviews found issues ***
Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for context.

Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 1 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Add
   runFsiProcess and runFscProcess CLI helpers: Add two subprocess helpers to
   Compiler.fs for legitimate CLI test cases:
1. `runFsiProcess` - runs fsi.exe as subprocess,
   captures stdout/stderr/exitcode (for --help, exit code tests)
2. `runFscProcess` - runs fsc.exe
    as subprocess, captures stdout/stderr/exitcode (for missing file CLI errors)
These are the
   ONLY subprocess helpers needed. Include unit tests for both helpers.

Reference
   VERIFICATION_v3_SuspiciousItems.md section 'BLOCKER 2: FSI help options' and 'BLOCKER 5:
   E_MissingSourceFile'.

Verification Criteria:
- Build succeeds: dotnet build
   tests/FSharp.Test.Utilities
- runFsiProcess helper exists in Compiler.fs
- runFscProcess
   helper exists in Compiler.fs
- Unit tests pass for both helpers

=== SPRINT REVIEW CHECKLIST ===
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL of these are true:
1. Build/compile succeeds without errors
2. All tests pass (new AND existing)
3. The feature works as specified
4. No TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
5. Implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

REJECT the sprint if tests are missing or failing.
REJECT the sprint if 'tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if the sprint delivers a complete, tested increment.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by bullet list of issues if not.

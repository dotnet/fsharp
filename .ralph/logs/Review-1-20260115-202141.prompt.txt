Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 1 is actually complete.

Verify existing Diagnostics
   migration: Verify that the completed Diagnostics migration (async.fs,
   General.fs, NONTERM.fs, ParsingAtEOF.fs) compiles and tests pass. Run:
   BUILDING_USING_DOTNET=true SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests -c Debug -f net10.0 --filter
   'FullyQualifiedName~Diagnostics'. Confirm fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics folder is deleted.
   Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md

Criteria:
- Command 'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~Diagnostics' completes without build errors
- All Diagnostics tests pass or skip gracefully (no failures)
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics does not exist

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

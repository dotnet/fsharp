SPRINT 1: Verification: Run full test suite

Run the full component test suite
   to verify the 93 tiebreaker tests still pass and no regressions were introduced. Verify the
   build succeeds with zero warnings. This sprint confirms the baseline quality of the
   implementation.

Steps:
1. Build the compiler: dotnet build
   src/Compiler/FSharp.Compiler.Service.fsproj -c Debug
2. Run tiebreaker tests: dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests.fsproj --filter
   "FullyQualifiedName~Tiebreakers" -c Debug
3. Verify 93 tests pass
4. Check formatting:
   dotnet fantomas . --check

No code changes expected - this is a verification sprint.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds with 0 errors
- 93/93 tiebreaker tests pass
- Formatting check passes (dotnet
    fantomas . --check)

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

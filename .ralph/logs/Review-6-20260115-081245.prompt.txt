Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 6 is actually complete.

Migrate incomplete and unexpected constructs: Move
   E_IncompleteConstruct01.fs, E_IncompleteConstruct01b.fs, E_UnexpectedKeyworkWith01.fs,
   E_MemberObjectctorTakeGiven.fs, E_StructMustHaveAtLeastOneField.fs, E_UnexpectedSymbol01.fs.
   These are parsing error tests. Add test methods.

Criteria:
- 6 files moved to
   resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 6 test methods added to General.fs
- Tests use
   typecheck and shouldFail

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

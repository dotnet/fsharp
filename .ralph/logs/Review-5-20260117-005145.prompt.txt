Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 5 is actually complete.

Migrate Conformance/Signatures: Migrate the Signatures test folder (~11 tests). Parse env.lst, create test file in
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/Signatures/, git-move source files, verify
   tests pass, delete fsharpqa folder. Reference:
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file exists
   in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/Signatures/
- Command 'dotnet test --filter
    FullyQualifiedName~Signatures' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/Signatures is empty or deleted
- Git commit made with
   descriptive message

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

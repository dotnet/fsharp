*** THIS IS ITERATION 3 - Previous iteration did not pass all DoD ***



Focus on the ❌ items. The ✅ items passed - don't break them.
Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for details on what failed.
Check git log and git diff to see what was already done.

SPRINT 1: Add concreteness explanation API

Add a function to
   OverloadResolutionRules.fs/fsi that computes a detailed explanation of why two types are
   incomparable under the concreteness ordering. This function should return per-position
   comparison results (e.g., 'position 0: int > 't', 'position 1: 'e < string'). Export both in the
    .fsi signature file. Use the existing compareTypeConcreteness function but return detailed
   position-by-position results instead of an aggregate. The function signature should be:
   explainIncomparableConcreteness: g:TcGlobals -> ty1:TType -> ty2:TType -> (int * TType * TType *
    int) list option, where the list contains (position, ty1Arg, ty2Arg, comparison) tuples. Return
    Some when types are incomparable (have mixed results), None otherwise.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build
   succeeds with 0 errors
- New function explainIncomparableConcreteness exists in
   OverloadResolutionRules.fs and .fsi
- Function correctly identifies incomparable type pairs and
    returns position details
- All existing tests pass (93 TiebreakerTests)

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    **VERIFY_FAILED**

   The task is incomplete. According to VISION.md's "Definition of Done (Final)":

   1. ✅ Items 1, 2, 5, 6 are marked as DONE
   2. ⬜ **Item 3: "Enhanced FS0041 error message explains why types are incomparable" - NOT DONE**
      - The `explainIncomparableConcreteness` function exists in OverloadResolutionRules.fs
      - However, it's not integrated into CompilerDiagnostics.fs to format the actual error message
      - The expected message text "Neither candidate is strictly more concrete" doesn't appear
   anywhere


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

SPRINT 4: Implement Quick Type Compatibility Check

Add a fast-path type compatibility check before full unification in
   FilterEachThenUndo. For each candidate, perform a quick structural comparison of caller arg
   types vs callee param types - if they're obviously incompatible (e.g., caller has int but callee
    expects IComparer with no generic match possible), skip full type checking. Must still handle
   type-directed conversions, generics, and param arrays correctly.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Quick compatibility
   check added before CanMemberSigsMatchUpToCheck
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing
   compiler tests pass
- Test cases cover: generics, param arrays, optional args, type-directed
   conversions
- Profiling shows additional speedup beyond arity filtering
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 4 updated with results

FIX THESE ISSUES:
- **Critical: The implementation is a no-op.** `CalledMethQuicklyCompatible` at line 574 returns
- **Critical: No actual filtering logic is active.** The `TypesQuicklyCompatible` function
- **No profiling data demonstrating speedup.** The METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md states
- **The "SRTP side effect" justification is incomplete.** The code comments reference discovered
- **The sprint deliverable was "implement quick type compatibility check" - not "add framework

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 13 is actually complete.

Migrate
   Conformance/Expressions: Migrate the Expressions test folders (~380 tests).
   This is the largest Conformance package. Subfolders include ApplicationExpressions,
   ConstantExpressions, ControlFlowExpressions, DataExpressions, ExpressionQuotations, and others.
   May need multiple commits. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify
    tests pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Reference:
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/Expressions/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~Expressions' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/Expressions is empty or deleted
- Git commit(s) made with
   descriptive messages

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

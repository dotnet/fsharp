Migrate
   Conformance/InferenceProcedures: Migrate the InferenceProcedures test folders
   (~124 tests): WellFormednessChecking, Generalization, TypeInference, NameResolution, and any
   other subfolders. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests
   pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md
   and /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s)
   exist in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/InferenceProcedures/
- Command
   'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~InferenceProcedures' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/InferenceProcedures is empty or deleted
- Git
   commit made with descriptive message

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 14 is actually complete.

Migrate Conformance/TypeForwarding: Migrate the TypeForwarding test folders (~303 tests): Interface, Cycle,
   Delegate, Struct, Class, Nested. These tests involve C# interop and type forwarding - may
   require CSharp compilation helpers. Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source
   files, verify tests pass, delete fsharpqa folders. Document any blockers in
   MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/TypeForwarding/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~TypeForwarding' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/TypeForwarding is empty or deleted (or blockers documented)
- Git commit(s) made with descriptive messages

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

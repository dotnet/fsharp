Implement subtask 3: Document FSI migration blockers

The fsi/help,
   fsi/highentropyva, and fsi/subsystemversion folders cannot be migrated due to
   FsiEvaluationSession.Create throwing StopProcessingExn. Create or update
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/CompilerOptions/fsi/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md
   documenting these 7 tests with technical details. Do NOT delete these fsharpqa folders - they
   represent known blockers. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md

Criteria:
- File
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/CompilerOptions/fsi/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md
   exists
- File documents all 7 blocked tests (4 help, 1 highentropyva, 1 subsystemversion, 1
   langversion help baseline)
- Directories tests/fsharpqa/Source/CompilerOptions/fsi/help,
   highentropyva, subsystemversion still exist (intentionally not deleted)

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

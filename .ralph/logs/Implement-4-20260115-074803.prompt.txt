Implement subtask 4: Migrate argument and sealed attribute tests

Move E_AreYouMissingAnArgumentToAFunction01.fs,
   E_AreYouMissingAnArgumentToAFunction01b.fs, E_ConsiderAddingSealedAttribute01.fsi,
   E_ConsiderAddingSealedAttribute01.fs, E_LiteralEnumerationMustHaveType01.fs. The sealed
   attribute test is a multi-file compilation (fsi + fs). Add test methods with
   withAdditionalSourceFile for multi-file case.

Criteria:
- 5 files moved to
   resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 4 test methods added (one multi-file test uses both .fsi
    and .fs)
- Multi-file test uses withAdditionalSourceFile pattern

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

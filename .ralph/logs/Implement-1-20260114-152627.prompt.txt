*** THIS IS ITERATION 2 - Previous attempts did not complete successfully ***

Check .ralph/PROBLEMS.md for issues from previous iterations.
Check git log and git diff to see what was already done.
Learn from previous attempts - do something DIFFERENT this time.

Implement subtask 1: Create
   tracking documents

Create MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md and
   TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/ to track issues discovered
   during migration. These will document tests that cannot be migrated and framework features that
   need to be added. Reference FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md Part 2 for format.

Criteria:
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md exists with proper markdown
   header
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md exists with
   proper markdown header
- Both files have placeholder sections for tracking issues

FIX THESE ISSUES:
- ● VERIFY_FAILED

   **Build:** Succeeded
   **Tests:** Failed with 294 errors

   The test failures appear to be related to:
   1. Language version compatibility tests (many tests with "langVersion: 7.0")
   2. Offside/indentation warnings in OffsideExceptions tests
   3. IWSAM (Interface With Static Abstract Members) tests
   4. Various interop and property tests


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

Implement subtask 5: Migrate property and constraint tests

Move E_IndexedPropertySetter01.fs,
   E_PropertyIsNotReadable01.fs, E_MemberConstraintsWithSpecialStatus01.fs,
   E_FoundInPowerPack_Matrix01.fs, E_UnexpectedKeywordAs01.fs. Add corresponding test methods.

Criteria:
- 5 files moved to resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 5 test
   methods added to General.fs
- Each test has correct error code from file's <Expects>

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

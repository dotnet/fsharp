SPRINT 2: Import C# extension methods

Migrate ~9 C# extension method import tests from
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Import/em_csharp_*.fs to
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Import/ImportTests.fs. Original files include
   em_csharp_class_nonvoid.fs, em_csharp_class_params.fs, em_csharp_class_void.fs,
   em_csharp_on_fsharp_1.fs, em_csharp_on_fsharp_2.fs, em_csharp_struct_nonvoid.fs,
   em_csharp_struct_params.fs, em_csharp_struct_void.fs. Use CSharp helper with extension method
   definitions and verify F# can consume them on both struct and class types. View originals with
   `git show origin/main:tests/fsharpqa/Source/Import/em_csharp_*.fs`.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds
   with 0 errors
- All existing Import tests still pass
- New C# extension method tests pass
- Coverage: All em_csharp_* scenarios covered (struct, class, void, nonvoid, params)
- Tests
   added to existing ImportTests.fs module

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

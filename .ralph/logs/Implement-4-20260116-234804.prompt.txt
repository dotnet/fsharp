Implement subtask 4: Migrate Conformance/LexicalFiltering

Migrate the 5 LexicalFiltering test
   folders (~28 tests): Basic/ByExample, Basic/OffsideExceptions,
   LexicalAnalysisOfTypeApplications, HashLight, HighPrecedenceApplication. Parse each env.lst,
   create test file in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/LexicalFiltering/, git-move
    source files to resources/tests/Conformance/LexicalFiltering/, verify tests pass, then delete
   fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/LexicalFiltering/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~LexicalFiltering' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/LexicalFiltering is empty or deleted
- Git commit made with
   descriptive message

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

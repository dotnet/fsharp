Implement subtask 2: Complete DIAG-ASYNC migration

Complete the async diagnostics
   migration. There are 15 tests in fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics/async/env.lst but only 4 tests in
   ComponentTests/Diagnostics/async.fs. Files are already in resources/. Add remaining 11 test
   cases to async.fs following the existing pattern. Parse env.lst for each test's SCFLAGS and
   source file. Use withErrorCode and withDiagnosticMessageMatches for assertions.

Criteria:
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Diagnostics/async.fs has 15
   test methods
- dotnet build tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests succeeds
- Running 'dotnet
   test --filter FullyQualifiedName~async' shows 15 tests

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

SPRINT 5: Optimize
   CalledMeth Construction

Profile CalledMeth construction in MethodCalls.fs and
   implement lazy initialization where possible. MakeCalledArgs (line 498) creates CalledArg
   objects for all parameters - defer this until needed. Avoid allocating intermediate data
   structures. Consider caching MethInfo parameter data that's repeatedly queried. Ensure
   correctness with existing tests.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- CalledMeth construction profiled with allocation
   data
- At least one lazy/deferred initialization implemented
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing compiler tests pass
- Profiling shows reduced allocations per overload
   resolution
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 3 updated with results

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

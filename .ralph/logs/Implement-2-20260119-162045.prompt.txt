SPRINT 2: Migrate
    FSI CLI tests (--help, exit codes)

Migrate the 7 FSI CLI tests that
   legitimately require subprocess:
1. Restore from git history: git show
   eb1873ff3:tests/fsharpqa/Source/CompilerOptions/fsi/help/ files
2. Create
   ComponentTests/CompilerOptions/fsi/FsiCliTests.fs
3. Use the new runFsiProcess helper
4.
   Tests: -?, --help, /?, --nologo -?, --langversion:?, --highentropyva+,
   --subsystemversion

Reference VERIFICATION_v3_SuspiciousItems.md 'BLOCKER 2' and git show
   eb1873ff3 for original test specs.

Verification Criteria:
- Build succeeds: dotnet build
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests
- Tests pass: dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~FsiCli' -c Release
- 7 FSI
   CLI tests migrated and passing

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment:
1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. The feature must work as specified

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When ALL criteria are met (including tests passing), COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

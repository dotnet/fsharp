Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 1 is actually complete.

Migrate
   W_redefineOperator files: Move W_redefineOperator03.fs through
   W_redefineOperator10.fs (6 files) from tests/fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics/General/ to
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/ using git mv. Add
   corresponding test methods to General.fs following the existing pattern (withOptions
   ["--test:ErrorRanges"; "-a"], typecheck, shouldSucceed with warning). Parse each file's
   <Expects> to determine the correct assertions.

Criteria:
- Files
   W_redefineOperator03.fs through W_redefineOperator10.fs exist in
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 6 new test methods
   added to General.fs for these files
- git status shows the files as renamed (not
   deleted+added)

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 7 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Comprehensive Testing and Validation: Run the full F# compiler test suite to
   ensure no regressions. Focus on overload resolution edge cases: generic methods, param arrays,
   optional parameters, named arguments, type-directed conversions, extension methods. Run
   benchmarks comparing original vs optimized compiler on the test project. Document final
   performance improvement.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Full test suite passes: dotnet build -c Release && dotnet
   test -c Release
- Edge case tests explicitly verified passing
- Benchmark comparison: original
    vs optimized on 1500-assertion project
- At least 50% improvement in untyped Assert.Equal
   compilation time
- No semantic changes to overload resolution (same method selected)
- Results
    documented in METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

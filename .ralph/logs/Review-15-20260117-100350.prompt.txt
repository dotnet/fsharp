Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 15 is actually complete.

Migrate remaining
   packages (Libraries, Misc, Stress, MultiTargeting): Migrate the smaller
   remaining packages: Libraries/Core/NativeInterop (~1 test), Libraries/Core/PartialTrust (~1
   test), Libraries/Portable (~4 tests), Misc (~31 tests), Stress (~4 tests), MultiTargeting (~3
   tests). Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass, delete
    fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s)
   created for each package
- All migrated tests pass or skip gracefully
- Directories
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Libraries, Misc, Stress, MultiTargeting are empty or deleted
- Git
   commit(s) made with descriptive messages

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

SPRINT 1: TypeExtensions/optional tests

Migrate ~22 optional type
   extension tests from
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/TypeExtensions/optional/ to
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/ObjectOrientedTypeDefinitions/TypeExtensions/op
   tional/Optional.fs. These test cross-assembly extension members on types from external DLLs.
   Original files include typeext_opt001-008.fs, E_typeext_opt005.fs, E_CrossModule01.fs,
   E_ModuleNotOpen.fs, E_NotInModule.fs, E_PrivateFields.fs, ShortNamesAllowed.fs. Use `git show
   origin/main:<path>` to view original test content. Create helper library compilations (lib000.fs
    through lib005.fs) and test both success and error scenarios for instance extensions, static
   extensions, properties, and cross-assembly access patterns.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Build succeeds:
   ./build.sh -c Release builds without errors
- Tests pass: dotnet test --filter
   'FullyQualifiedName~TypeExtensions.Optional' passes all new tests
- Coverage: All 22 original
   optional extension scenarios migrated
- No duplication: Helper library patterns reused across
   tests
- Correct location: Tests in TypeExtensions/optional/ subfolder

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

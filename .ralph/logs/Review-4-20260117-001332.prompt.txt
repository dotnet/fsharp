Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 4 is actually complete.

Migrate Conformance/LexicalFiltering: Migrate the 5 LexicalFiltering test
   folders (~28 tests): Basic/ByExample, Basic/OffsideExceptions,
   LexicalAnalysisOfTypeApplications, HashLight, HighPrecedenceApplication. Parse each env.lst,
   create test file in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/LexicalFiltering/, git-move
    source files to resources/tests/Conformance/LexicalFiltering/, verify tests pass, then delete
   fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s) exist
    in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Conformance/LexicalFiltering/
- Command 'dotnet test
   --filter FullyQualifiedName~LexicalFiltering' passes or skips gracefully
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Conformance/LexicalFiltering is empty or deleted
- Git commit made with
   descriptive message

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

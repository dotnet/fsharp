SPRINT 1: Add
   runFsiProcess and runFscProcess CLI helpers

Add two subprocess helpers to
   Compiler.fs for legitimate CLI test cases:
1. `runFsiProcess` - runs fsi.exe as subprocess,
   captures stdout/stderr/exitcode (for --help, exit code tests)
2. `runFscProcess` - runs fsc.exe
    as subprocess, captures stdout/stderr/exitcode (for missing file CLI errors)
These are the
   ONLY subprocess helpers needed. Include unit tests for both helpers.

Reference
   VERIFICATION_v3_SuspiciousItems.md section 'BLOCKER 2: FSI help options' and 'BLOCKER 5:
   E_MissingSourceFile'.

Verification Criteria:
- Build succeeds: dotnet build
   tests/FSharp.Test.Utilities
- runFsiProcess helper exists in Compiler.fs
- runFscProcess
   helper exists in Compiler.fs
- Unit tests pass for both helpers

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment:
1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. The feature must work as specified

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL criteria are met (including tests passing), COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

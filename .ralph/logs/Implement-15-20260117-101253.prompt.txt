Implement subtask 15: Migrate remaining
   packages (Libraries, Misc, Stress, MultiTargeting)

Migrate the smaller
   remaining packages: Libraries/Core/NativeInterop (~1 test), Libraries/Core/PartialTrust (~1
   test), Libraries/Portable (~4 tests), Misc (~31 tests), Stress (~4 tests), MultiTargeting (~3
   tests). Parse env.lst files, create test files, git-move source files, verify tests pass, delete
    fsharpqa folders. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md and
   /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FEATURE_MAPPING.md

Criteria:
- Test file(s)
   created for each package
- All migrated tests pass or skip gracefully
- Directories
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Libraries, Misc, Stress, MultiTargeting are empty or deleted
- Git
   commit(s) made with descriptive messages

FIX THESE ISSUES:
-    **VERIFY_FAILED**

   **Test Summary:** total: 6251, failed: 307, succeeded: 5668, skipped: 276

   **Status:** Build succeeded but tests failed with exit code 1.

   **Classification:**
   ```
   TestFailure:
     Command: ./build.sh -c Release --testcoreclr


IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

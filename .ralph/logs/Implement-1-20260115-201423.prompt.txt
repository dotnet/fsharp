Implement subtask 1: Verify existing Diagnostics
   migration

Verify that the completed Diagnostics migration (async.fs,
   General.fs, NONTERM.fs, ParsingAtEOF.fs) compiles and tests pass. Run:
   BUILDING_USING_DOTNET=true SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet test
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests -c Debug -f net10.0 --filter
   'FullyQualifiedName~Diagnostics'. Confirm fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics folder is deleted.
   Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md

Criteria:
- Command 'dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~Diagnostics' completes without build errors
- All Diagnostics tests pass or skip gracefully (no failures)
- Directory
   tests/fsharpqa/Source/Diagnostics does not exist

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

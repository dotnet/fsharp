Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 1 is actually complete.

Create
   tracking documents: Create MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md and
   TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md in tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/ to track issues discovered
   during migration. These will document tests that cannot be migrated and framework features that
   need to be added. Reference FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md Part 2 for format.

Criteria:
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md exists with proper markdown
   header
- File tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/TEST_FRAMEWORK_ADDITIONS.md exists with
   proper markdown header
- Both files have placeholder sections for tracking issues

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

Output REVIEW_PASSED if complete.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by bullet list of issues if not.

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

=== HUMAN NOTES (read carefully, high priority) ===
Pls do use the env var for skipping lang version check, otherwise you will get a lot of test failures. The code looks for:
System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK") = "1".

Run the tests in release mode, there might be some behaviour depending on it. I did prebuild the compiler itself in release mode for you.
=== END NOTES ===

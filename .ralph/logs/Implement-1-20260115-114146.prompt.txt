Implement subtask 1: Migrate ComponentTests
   Interop files

Migrate 3 files in
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Interop/:
- RequiredAndInitOnlyProperties.fs (15 uses of
   withLangVersion70)
- StaticsInInterfaces.fs (8 uses of withLangVersion70)
- VisibilityTests.fs
    (4 uses of withLangVersion70, 4 uses of withLangVersion50)

Replace all
   withLangVersion50/60/70 with withLangVersion80.

Criteria:
- grep -n
   'withLangVersion(46|47|50|60|70)' tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/Interop/*.fs returns 0
   matches
- SKIP_VERSION_SUPPORTED_CHECK=1 dotnet build tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests
   exits 0

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

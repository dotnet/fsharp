Verify the task is complete based on acceptance criteria in .ralph/VISION.md.

IMPORTANT: Adapt your verification approach to the task type:

For coding tasks:
  - Check for build instructions (Makefile, package.json, *.proj, README)
  - Run appropriate build and test commands
  - Output VERIFY_PASSED if build and tests succeed

For documentation/design tasks (RFCs, docs, specs, proposals):
  - Check the document exists and is complete
  - Verify it addresses the requirements from VISION.md
  - Check for proper formatting, structure, and clarity
  - DO NOT attempt to build or test - just verify document quality
  - Output VERIFY_PASSED if the document meets the criteria

For other task types:
  - Use judgment based on the actual work requested
  - Verify against the criteria in VISION.md

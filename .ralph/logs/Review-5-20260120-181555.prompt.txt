Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 5 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Optimize
   CalledMeth Construction: Profile CalledMeth construction in MethodCalls.fs and
   implement lazy initialization where possible. MakeCalledArgs (line 498) creates CalledArg
   objects for all parameters - defer this until needed. Avoid allocating intermediate data
   structures. Consider caching MethInfo parameter data that's repeatedly queried. Ensure
   correctness with existing tests.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- CalledMeth construction profiled with allocation
   data
- At least one lazy/deferred initialization implemented
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing compiler tests pass
- Profiling shows reduced allocations per overload
   resolution
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 3 updated with results

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

Implement subtask 6: Migrate incomplete and unexpected constructs

Move
   E_IncompleteConstruct01.fs, E_IncompleteConstruct01b.fs, E_UnexpectedKeyworkWith01.fs,
   E_MemberObjectctorTakeGiven.fs, E_StructMustHaveAtLeastOneField.fs, E_UnexpectedSymbol01.fs.
   These are parsing error tests. Add test methods.

Criteria:
- 6 files moved to
   resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 6 test methods added to General.fs
- Tests use
   typecheck and shouldFail

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

Do one unit of work. Build and tests must pass.
Do NOT commit yet - commit only when subtask is fully complete.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this subtask is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

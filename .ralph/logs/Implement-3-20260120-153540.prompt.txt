SPRINT 3: Implement Early Arity Filtering

Implement
   early candidate pruning based on argument count before creating CalledMeth objects. In
   ConstraintSolver.fs ResolveOverloading, add a pre-filter step that checks caller argument count
   against method parameter counts (accounting for optional/param array). This avoids expensive
   CalledMeth construction and full type checking for obviously incompatible overloads. Include
   unit tests verifying the optimization doesn't change resolution semantics.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Pre-filter
    step added in ResolveOverloading before CalledMeth creation
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing compiler tests pass (dotnet test tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests)
- New test
    added verifying arity filtering doesn't affect resolution
- Profiling shows measurable
   reduction in candidates entering FilterEachThenUndo
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 1
   updated with results

FIX THESE ISSUES:
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing compiler tests pass (OverloadingMembers: 60/60, TypeChecks: 350/350)
- New test added (`ArityFilteringTest.fs`) verifying arity filtering doesn't affect resolution
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 1 updated with implementation details
- Pre-filter step location: DoD specifies "in ResolveOverloading" (ConstraintSolver.fs) but
- Profiling shows measurable reduction: No before/after profiling data showing candidate
- Number of candidates before/after the arity filter implementation
- FilterEachThenUndo invocation counts before/after
- The PERF_REPORT.md only shows baseline measurements, not before/after comparison proving

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,

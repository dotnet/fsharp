Skeptical reviewer. Verify SPRINT 3 delivers a complete, tested product increment.

Implement Early Arity Filtering: Implement
   early candidate pruning based on argument count before creating CalledMeth objects. In
   ConstraintSolver.fs ResolveOverloading, add a pre-filter step that checks caller argument count
   against method parameter counts (accounting for optional/param array). This avoids expensive
   CalledMeth construction and full type checking for obviously incompatible overloads. Include
   unit tests verifying the optimization doesn't change resolution semantics.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Pre-filter
    step added in ResolveOverloading before CalledMeth creation
- Compiler builds with 0 errors
- All existing compiler tests pass (dotnet test tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests)
- New test
    added verifying arity filtering doesn't affect resolution
- Profiling shows measurable
   reduction in candidates entering FilterEachThenUndo
- METHOD_RESOLUTION_PERF_IDEAS.md Idea 1
   updated with results

=== DoD VALIDATION ===
Check EACH DoD criterion and report pass/fail for each.
A sprint is ONLY complete if ALL DoD items pass.

REJECT the sprint if:
- Any DoD criterion fails
- Tests are missing or failing
- 'Tests will be added later' - tests must be NOW
- TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations
- Implementation doesn't align with .ralph/VISION.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Output REVIEW_PASSED if ALL DoD items pass.
Output REVIEW_FAILED followed by:
  PASSED: criterion1, criterion2
  FAILED: criterion3, criterion4
  ISSUES: bullet list of specific problems

Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 5 is actually complete.

Migrate property and constraint tests: Move E_IndexedPropertySetter01.fs,
   E_PropertyIsNotReadable01.fs, E_MemberConstraintsWithSpecialStatus01.fs,
   E_FoundInPowerPack_Matrix01.fs, E_UnexpectedKeywordAs01.fs. Add corresponding test methods.

Criteria:
- 5 files moved to resources/tests/Diagnostics/General/
- 5 test
   methods added to General.fs
- Each test has correct error code from file's <Expects>

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

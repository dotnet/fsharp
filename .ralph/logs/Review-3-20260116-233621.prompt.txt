Skeptical reviewer. Verify subtask 3 is actually complete.

Document FSI migration blockers: The fsi/help,
   fsi/highentropyva, and fsi/subsystemversion folders cannot be migrated due to
   FsiEvaluationSession.Create throwing StopProcessingExn. Create or update
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/CompilerOptions/fsi/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md
   documenting these 7 tests with technical details. Do NOT delete these fsharpqa folders - they
   represent known blockers. Reference: /Users/tomasgrosup/code/fsharp/FSHARPQA_MIGRATION.md

Criteria:
- File
   tests/FSharp.Compiler.ComponentTests/resources/tests/CompilerOptions/fsi/MIGRATION_BLOCKERS.md
   exists
- File documents all 7 blocked tests (4 help, 1 highentropyva, 1 subsystemversion, 1
   langversion help baseline)
- Directories tests/fsharpqa/Source/CompilerOptions/fsi/help,
   highentropyva, subsystemversion still exist (intentionally not deleted)

Check code, build, tests. Look for incomplete work, TODOs, placeholders.
Also verify implementation aligns with .ralph/VISION.md

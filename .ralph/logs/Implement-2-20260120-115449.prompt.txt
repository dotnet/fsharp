SPRINT 2: Audit: RFC example coverage verification

Systematically verify that each RFC example from section-examples.md is covered
   by tests. Create a mapping document showing RFC Example N -> Test Name.

RFC Examples to
   verify:
- Example 1: Basic Generic vs Concrete (Option<'t> vs Option<int>)
- Example 2: Fully
   Generic vs Wrapped ('t vs Option<'t>)
- Example 3: Nested Generics (Option<Option<'t>> vs
   Option<Option<int>>)
- Example 4: Triple Nesting Depth
- Example 5: Multiple Type Parameters -
    Result Type
- Example 6: Incomparable Concreteness (Result<int, 'e> vs Result<'t, string>)
-
   Example 7: ValueTask Constructor Scenario
- Example 8: CE Builder Source Overloads
- Example
   9: CE Bind with Task Types
- Example 10-12: Optional and ParamArray interactions
- Example 13:
    Extension Methods
- Example 14: Span with Generic Element Types
- Example 15: Constrained vs
   Unconstrained (DEFERRED - F# limitation)

Update VISION.md with verification results.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- All 14 implementable RFC examples verified in test suite
- Example 15 confirmed as deferred
   (FS0438 language limitation)
- VISION.md updated with example coverage mapping

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for context and design decisions.

=== SPRINT COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ===
This sprint MUST deliver a TESTED, BUILDING product increment.
ALL DoD items must pass for the sprint to be complete.

1. Write/update code AND tests together (not separately)
2. Run build - it MUST succeed
3. Run tests - they MUST pass
4. Verify each DoD criterion is satisfied

Do NOT commit untested code. Tests are part of THIS sprint, not a future one.

If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.

REPLANNING: If this sprint is impossible, wrong, or should be restructured,
create .ralph/REPLAN.md explaining why and proposing changes. The orchestrator
will trigger replanning. Use this for fundamental issues, not minor obstacles.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When ALL DoD items are satisfied, COMMIT your changes,
then output: SUBTASK_COMPLETE

IMPORTANT: Read .ralph/VISION.md for project context and design decisions.
If you hit a design obstacle, UPDATE .ralph/VISION.md with your findings.
